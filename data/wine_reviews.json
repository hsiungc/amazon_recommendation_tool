I mean I can! but I don’t always want to drink a bottle in the 2 days that an open bottle stays and keeps its flavor.\nThis gadget makes the wine last sooo much longer. Easily makes an open bottle of wine last the week and keep its flavor. I am so happy this came into my life and I am not wasting wine anymore!\nThe price is so inexpensive, but this gadget is so good, especially when considering how much wine it has saved me. Before, I would have to pour out the old wine, now it keeps and I enjoy it later, saving me so much vino! And let’s face it.. that is a priority!\nI highly recommend!!"
    },
    {
     "name": "The product works great for what I purchase it for, and that's to help conserve my wine. That being said, I don't much care for the design. There is an aluminum ring on the cap that you can use to set the date you opened the wine, which may be a good idea for some, but it is something I virtually never use. In addition, the ring tends to come off easily. When that happens, I just toss it because I don't use it anyway. The only other thing I've noticed is that the pump fits rather tightly on the cap so when you try to detach it, it sometimes pulls the cap off with it. I'm not sure much can be done about that because you need a tight seal in order to create a vacuum in the wine bottle anyway. I've just learned to hold onto the cap while detaching the pump. Other than those minor things, this is a great product."
    },
    {
     "name": "They mailed me a card to submit a 5 point review to get a $5 Amazon gift card. The wine strippers are decent and not to bad to use, but the seal is not dependable. Switched back to regular stoppers after a few weeks. I would have likely given more than 1 star, but I hate companies that try to buy reviews."
    },
    {
     "name": "Honestly, i can't think of anything to take any stars off for, good value for the money, the stoppers all seem to hold the air out well, and it's easy to use. It's held up well for about 6 bottles of wine, over the course of 2-3 months, so not a ton of use. I see it holding up well for the value I paid. Also I like the fitted foam it came in, i'd like to make a wood box for it to keep it in, saving the foam for that purpose! If the vendor made a more expensive version in a decent wood box for storage, i'd buy it! For comparison, I've had one or two others from other brands, this one seems as good or a bit better than those others I have used in the past."

    {
     "name": "It does what it is supposed to do. It's well built and stylish. I must confess that I don't keep a bottle of wine open for very long, two or three days usually, but I can taste the effect of oxygen on the wine after a day. This tool helps retain the taste that the wine had on the day that I first opened the bottle. Being the lazy guy that I am, I wish that they made one with an electric pump. I mean, who wants to stand there, half stewed, pumping away on a half-empty bottle of wine? Just kidding."

     "name": "This wine vacuum pump with stoppers was super easy to use, especially for a beginner! If needed, instructions are clearly listed both on the box and in a little pamphlet inside the box.

The price is fair for such a nifty tool, I would definitely order again as gifts."
    },
    {
     "name": "This type of wine saver works well so long as the bottle is at least half full and you drink the remainder in a day or two. There are limits to how much air you can actually pump out so the more wine left in the bottle the more effective it will be. When I do lave less than a half bottle of red I pump it and then store it in the fridge. Hopefully i then remember to set it out an hour or two before drinking."

I wasn't really happy with any of them.\nProducts that used to be designed well and work great, all of a sudden did not work the same anymore (even when stoppers were replaced).\nIn desperation I bought this pump and the reviews did not lie. It is amazing.\nIt feels so tight that unlike the others, I wouldn't feel worried putting the wine bottle on its side (but I don't typically do that).\nI use it all the time!"

     "name": "This is my first experience with a wine vaccum. I like that it keeps the wine fresh longer and that works for me.

Its just repetition, the more you use it the easier it becomes to use."

    {
     "name": "This is one of the best wines savers that I've had so far. It has a dial on top to point to the day that you opened the bottle. And the top has a little release valve on it to relieve the suction. It also keeps the suction the entire time without escaping. This is a great wine saver."

     "name": "This doesn't work as you would think it does.\nYou would think that you'd put the plug in the wine bottle and then simply put the pump on top and pump the air out. There's some problems with that\n1. there isn't a seal between the pump and the plug. You have to hold the pump on top of the plug\n2. The pump does not release the air on the return stroke so it never really makes a vacuume\nIn the end I did one stroke of the pump to get the air out the air out then move the pump off and on the plug and suck the air out again with the pump. I finally gave up and returned it"
    },
    {
     "name": "This is easy to use and works perfectly. It takes longer to read the instructions (or this review!) than to use it. It keeps the wine fresh with minimal cost and effort. I'm the only wine-drinker in our household so this is important to me; stale wine can be awful. I like having four of the stoppers, although currently it's more than I will ever have open at once. A high-quality product at a low price."

My last wine vacuum was electric and stopped working after about 50 uses. I came across this set, and I love it! It's so easy to use. You place the stoppers on the bottle and pump 15-20 times until resistance is felt while pumping. When reopening the bottle, release the air with the tab at the top of the stopper and open the bottle. The wine stays fresh, and I also love that I received more than a couple of stoppers. Highly recommend."

    {
     "name": "Love this thing! Super easy to use, love hearing that pfssst sound a day or two later when I pull off the top to pour another glass of wine. Keeps wine fresh tasting for up to 4 days. Works on most bottles. I had one screw top white wine where this didn't fit, but some screw top wine bottles it does fit. It's worked on all corked bottles I've tried it on. Well worth the price!"
    },
    {
     "name": "This is the perfect item for anyone who doesn’t always finish a bottle of wine. Just place the cap on the open bottle and slip on the easy to use pump. A few pumps later, your bottle is sealed, and will remain so until you’re ready for some more. With an freshness reminder built in to the cap, you’ll always know when you resealed the bottle. It’s a great addition to your wine collection!"

The instructions were crystal clear and it was EZ to use immediately on a freshly opened bottle of wine. I researched a bunch and this was the best one out there - and I am extremely happy with the purchase. I got the one with 2 vacuum stoppers but there is also another that comes with 4. Get yourself on - they are great and the price is about 1//3 of what you would think it could be."

     "name": "Makes preserving wine an easy task. Nice solid construction on all pieces. Fits perfectly in the refrigerator on the side racks after sealing air tight. Easy to use. Purchased the one with 4 wine plugs. My wine definitely stays fresher after a couple weeks with the Wine Saver in the refrigerator & at room temperature."

     "name": "Love this.\nI am the only wine drinker in the house, but can’t always drink a full bottle of wine in 2days. I mean I can! but I don’t always want to drink a bottle in the 2 days that an open bottle stays and keeps its flavor.\nThis gadget makes the wine last sooo much longer. Easily makes an open bottle of wine last the week and keep its flavor. I am so happy this came into my life and I am not wasting wine anymore!\nThe price is so inexpensive, but this gadget is so good, especially when considering how much wine it has saved me. Before, I would have to pour out the old wine, now it keeps and I enjoy it later, saving me so much vino! And let’s face it.. that is a priority!\nI highly recommend!!"

    {
     "name": "The product works great for what I purchase it for, and that's to help conserve my wine. That being said, I don't much care for the design. There is an aluminum ring on the cap that you can use to set the date you opened the wine, which may be a good idea for some, but it is something I virtually never use. In addition, the ring tends to come off easily. When that happens, I just toss it because I don't use it anyway. The only other thing I've noticed is that the pump fits rather tightly on the cap so when you try to detach it, it sometimes pulls the cap off with it. I'm not sure much can be done about that because you need a tight seal in order to create a vacuum in the wine bottle anyway. I've just learned to hold onto the cap while detaching the pump. Other than those minor things, this is a great product."

     "name": "They mailed me a card to submit a 5 point review to get a $5 Amazon gift card. The wine strippers are decent and not to bad to use, but the seal is not dependable. Switched back to regular stoppers after a few weeks. I would have likely given more than 1 star, but I hate companies that try to buy reviews."
    },
    {
     "name": "Honestly, i can't think of anything to take any stars off for, good value for the money, the stoppers all seem to hold the air out well, and it's easy to use. It's held up well for about 6 bottles of wine, over the course of 2-3 months, so not a ton of use. I see it holding up well for the value I paid. Also I like the fitted foam it came in, i'd like to make a wood box for it to keep it in, saving the foam for that purpose! If the vendor made a more expensive version in a decent wood box for storage, i'd buy it! For comparison, I've had one or two others from other brands, this one seems as good or a bit better than those others I have used in the past."

I must confess that I don't keep a bottle of wine open for very long, two or three days usually, but I can taste the effect of oxygen on the wine after a day. This tool helps retain the taste that the wine had on the day that I first opened the bottle. Being the lazy guy that I am, I wish that they made one with an electric pump. I mean, who wants to stand there, half stewed, pumping away on a half-empty bottle of wine? Just kidding."

     "name": "This wine vacuum pump with stoppers was super easy to use, especially for a beginner! If needed, instructions are clearly listed both on the box and in a little pamphlet inside the box. It only took a couple pumps and the bottle was completely sealed which kept the wine fresh for about a week as described. The pump and stoppers are easy to store. The price is fair for such a nifty tool, I would definitely order again as gifts."
    },
    {
     "name": "This type of wine saver works well so long as the bottle is at least half full and you drink the remainder in a day or two. There are limits to how much air you can actually pump out so the more wine left in the bottle the more effective it will be. When I do lave less than a half bottle of red I pump it and then store it in the fridge. Hopefully i then remember to set it out an hour or two before drinking."

I wasn't really happy with any of them.\nProducts that used to be designed well and work great, all of a sudden did not work the same anymore (even when stoppers were replaced).\nIn desperation I bought this pump and the reviews did not lie. It is amazing.\nIt feels so tight that unlike the others, I wouldn't feel worried putting the wine bottle on its side (but I don't typically do that).\nI use it all the time!"

I even ordered the same brand I have now. You are supposed to put the stopper in the bottle and pump the air out with a special device that I originally bought. You pump until you hear it making clicking sounds. That tells you the air has been pumped out. Only 1 properly pumped and clicked. I about wore my arm out trying to pump the others. My husband tried as well and got the same result. When comparing the one that worked with the others, you can see they are not made the same. The one that works has a round bottom and the other is deformed and won’t seal properly (in photo, the left one is deformed). Even the slightest difference is shape will not allow a proper seal. Luckily one of my originals is still working and I’ll keep the one from this pack that functions properly. Had to throw the others out. Disappointing when the quality control is so bad. I’d recommend buying this product at a reputable wine store."

At first the older pump seemed to create the vacuum with these stoppers, but when I went to open the bottle again, the vacuum had leaked air into the bottle.

     "name": "If you're a wine lover, chances are you may have a few bottles of wine uncorked at any given time. That was the case here--I had one bottle of dry red wine open for cooking, another dessert wine chilling in the fridge...and a third bottle I had just opened. The Vacu Vin only came with two stoppers, so buying this six pack was a necessity. The product does work well to evacuate the oxygen from an open bottle--if you are reading this prior to deciding on a Vacu Vin, I can safely recommend purchasing it, and buying these along with it. The 6-pack is a far better deal than the smaller packages. And knowing how things tend to \"disappear\" in our kitchen, having a few spares is always helpful!"

     "name": "This brand may be a best seller but when you type in \"wine stoppers\" how many other brands and styles to you see? Only one on the first page so here's the scoop in short and brief summary.\nBuy a brand such as Le Creuset which have several rows of thin flanges. This style makes a longer lasting seal and much more effective seal but. this Vacu Vin design has one advantage because it is a conical tapered shape (smooth sides) and if you need to use it on a bottle which has a larger than standard hole it will fit better than the straight sided design with the flanges. But it has no flanges. it depends on you pushing it very firmly into the bottle as you pump out the air. But when you release the air you will always hear a much, much larger sucking sound when releasing the multiple-flange style compared to the VV design. I have \"corked\" more than 200 times with the Vacu Vin. I have \"corked\" more than 2000 times using two other brands with much superior design and these VacuVin stoppers which are always the loser by a very noticeable difference.\nI'm asking Amzn to accept a return. When you're trying to save a $60.00 bottle of wine you want what works and after more than 200 uses, i am certain that the Vacu Vin shape and design is inferior to the designs with multiple thin flanges. it's not rocket science. three rows of thin flanges create many times more holding power than a smooth skin of the Vacu Vin design being pressed to the slick glass."

     "name": "Been drinking wine for 60 years and bought the Vacu-Vin system when it was first introduced in the 80's. Before then I was using corks and had 'spoiled wine' in a matter of days. With Vacu-Vin, I was able to go a week with younger wines about 2-3 days on older vintages. I still use Vacu-Vin products as it has been solid and reputable. I've tried others and they didn't work as well - perhaps its the many ribs you see that help the vacuum seal last longer. I've tried the nitrogen gas and all that fancy stuff, but those were just too much trouble and cost far more.\nThe best part for me are two reasons I use it:\n(1) Rather than trying to find half-bottles I can easily save the remaining wine for 3 days (or more) and spend less on the wine (Half bottles are more expensive and less choice).\n(2) I don't feel bad or concerned about opening a special bottle like the one on the left in the picture because I can enjoy it over 2-3 days.\nIt's easy to use. You'll start replacing corks after 25 years just to get a better seal. That relatively inexpensive compared to all the wine that will spoil if you don't use a vacu vin. regards..m"

     "name": "I’ve used four different vacuum wine stoppers over the past few years.\nOne brand is similar to Vacu Vin in that it has an external pump. These wouldn’t develop as much suction as Vacu Vin and would only maintain the vacuum for a day or two. After 3 or 4 years 3 one of the stoppers failed completely (would not seal at all) and the other would maintain the vacuum for about 30 minutes.\nThe two other brands had built-in pumps. I did prefer the convenience of built-in pumps but there was less suction, they only maintained the vacuum for more a couple of days, and they failed completely after about two years.\nMeanwhile, my original Vacu Vin - which I’ve had for about 10 years - still maintains a vacuum for a couple of days. And the new Vacu Vin stoppers I just got (actual Vacu Vin, not knock-offs) maintained a strong vacuum seal on a newly open bottle of red wine for 12 days."

These new ones don't look as pictured - are black instead of grey, and only have 3 vent holes vs. 4, which increases the time it takes to pump air from a wine bottle. Finally, the center vacuum relief nub has some rubber stems from the molding process still attached - the ones I already had lacked these and were well-finished.\nIn summary, they're usable, but they don't quite feel right, as though they're a knockoff vs. a genuine Vacu Vin product. Then too, it could also simply be that Vacu Vin has changed the design and is going cheaper in it's production standards.\n-----------\nUpdate - a few weeks later, two have stopped holding a vacuum. Very frustratins. I ran over to Bed Bath & Beyond and - low and behold - they have the real Vacu Vin stoppers that look like the ones pictured in this seller's ad. With that, I have to say this seller is misrepresenting what they're selling, and these are not the genuine article. I'd advise anyone to stay away from this one."

The items that were shipped are black in color and in the pictures they are compared to the stoppers by Vacu Vin Inc. They do however seem hold a seal in a bottle. Time will tell if they last as long as the \"actual\" ones that I had previously purchased."

When I die I expect to meet up with the odd socks that mysteriously disappear in the dryer and my missing Vacu Vin stoppers.\nI have kept a bottle of red wine perfect for well over a month with the Vacu Vin system. These do precisely what they are intended to do."

I'm not sure how difficult it would be to clean the rubber if they were used with wine stored horizontally.\nThe only \"trick\" to using them that I have found is that it helps to hold the stopper flush against the bottle with one hand while pushing the lever down with the other.

The flip down expanding design allows you to lay the bottles down in the fridge (white wine) or stand them up in the door. Many of the cone shaped ones are too tall for the door, and will leak if you lay them down. Before I used this product, I filled an empty wine bottle with water, put the stopper in, flipped it over and put it in the sink overnight. Not a drop escaped. We liked them so much that we ordered two more sets, one for my mother and one for friends."

     "name": "The only way I can get these to seal a bottle of Miller Lite is to place it in the opening then when the lever is down expanding the plug I carefully pull the stopper up till it almost comes out of the bottle. That's the only way to get a tight fit. If I were to insert the stopper all the way in then lower the lever the fit is very loose. It must be pulled up into the upper narrower part of the bottle neck."

I'm not using it for wine but I'm assuming if it can hold in the carbonation in Seltzer it can keep out oxygen or whatever degrades wine. So far it's held up very well even in multiple washings and mechanically it seems sturdy enough"

Sticking a used cork and chipping the cork back down into a wine bottle can be quite frustrating, especially when you just want to preserve the wine much longer.\nSmart purchase and definitely a cool life hack I had wished I had known sooner. My moms happy, so I'm happy.\nI'll get more if they break , but they seem to last pretty good. The ones that aren't being used currently sit in a drawer until the time is right to use them."

     "name": "Works good for saving a half bottle of beer.\nYeah, I know, why not just finish the bottle?\nBecause sometimes, I just don't want that much.\nI buy good, expensive craft beer.\nSometimes it comes in large bottles.\nI don't want to just chug it down, but I'm certainly not going to dump it out. I want to be able to save a half bottle for later or the next day.\nThis is the solution."

     "name": "I'm very disappointed that these stoppers do not expand enough to fill at least two different European bottlenecks - one Greek and one French.

    },
    {
     "name": "I've only had these for a few days, but so far they are working fine, as in my wine bottles on their side don't leak. For me, to get the fifth star they should be somewhat shorter in over all height and not go so far into the bottle. They wobble a bit when used, but don't leak. They are doing their job perfectly, but could be tweaked a bit. No idea about how long they will continue to be leak free."

    {
     "name": "Easy way to seal a wine bottle, that will be used shortly. I even have it lying on its side in the wine cooler and have no leaking. I use a vacuum sealer for some bottles, but this works fine for most. Also good for something with a bit of a fizz, but I don't put those on their side."

    },

As soon as I cap off the carbonated beverage, the stopper got pushed to the top of bottle and I thought it was going to pop off. This is dangerous and given it wouldn't stay in the completely down position in the bottle...I just wasted $16."
    },
    {
     "name": "I was excited to get these, but a little disappointed as well. They don't seem to seat well so the seal is not always made. In fact they look a little lopsided after inserting them in the wine bottle. One of them wouldn't even expand so therefore is probably useless."

I have been using an old santa wine stopper, with a broken hat, for at least a year. Once in awhile (when the wine actually remains in the fridge and doesn't get drank ;) my wine gets tipped over and santa falls out. These cute wine stoppers fix that problem, check out my pictures. You can completely turn over your wine bottle and these babies aren't going anywhere. Plus, they are less bacteria friendly. They are really easy to wash, unlike stoppers (like santa) that have the cork stop. I love these sassy wine stoppers and will keep them in mind for all of my girlfriend's birthdays :) (because this set is mine!!)\nDisclaimer: I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, which I have provided.

They go on and come off easy and I while I haven't tried storing my wines on their side (I have no need to) they have a little lip on the inside that the lip of the bottle fits into and seems like it is a god snug fit. I don't really care for the phrases on them, but these were the cheapest option and I can live with it."
    },
    {
     "name": "After using these, I will throw away all of my internal stoppers. These fasten around the sides of the bottle at the top. They have really worked for me and can keep wine remnants for several days. Of course, you could argue that you should just finish up that remnant immediately, but if you are watching your calories with wine at dinner, then these will hold over the rest of the bottle very well. Also--They Make Great Gifts."
    },
    {
     "name": "These works very well. They snugly fit the bottle top but not so tight that it is difficult to get on. They are the anti wine stopper that can take the pretentious wine snob down a peg or two. And let's not forget the soda bottle or the bottle of oil that is topless because your cat chased the top under the refrigerator. Surely there is something in the bathroom that needs a cap too."
    },
    {
     "name": "Love them - they work great, and i don't have a big piece/lever on top (like some air tight models) making it difficult to put on top shelf in fridge. I don't know how well they would keep the fizz of a champagne bottle yet, ...i rarely have left overs ;) - but it does fit on top of one."

I wouldn't bother with a soda bottle since they have a reusable cap already, but if you lost it or found the sealer easier to handle, you could.\nI'm just now repurchasing in 2016 because the outside plastic has gotten gummy and sticky (not from not washing it). I don't know if it's a coating they use that degraded or what, but while it doesn't affect the function of it on the inside, it feels funny and looks like it's dirty (but won't wash off). I like it so much, I hunted it up to buy new again, and will continue to do so as long as they make it (or someone invents something better!). Great little device!"

Sadly, none of the three came even close to my store bought Rabbit. They had a very poor seal, so bottles of Prosecco went flat in less than 24 hours. I see that the ones from Amazon have a shorter plug in the center than my original. I wonder if it was made in the same place as my original. Also there are depressions in all three amazon stoppers.... which are not seen in my original one. I will not gift them. I ended up buying another brand that’s three times as expensive, but works well."

I don't think we have tried using it to keep a bottle much longer than a day, maybe two at the most, but it always works to keep the champagne fresh and sparkling. The mechanism is very easy to use, just make sure it is loosened and then insert and tighten to the right until it is good and snug. We have had ours for over a year now and it still works perfectly. We have tried a few other types and this works this best by far.\nIn the interest of full disclosure, our champagne habits are pretty narrow. We typically drink Korbel or Moet and just go through a few bottles for mimosas on a Sunday for brunch, or for a special occasion. I suspect we use this device no more than a couple of times a month on average, except for maybe around the holidays so YMMV."

I immediately ordered this. After receiving I put it on said champagne.

We have used a variety of different silicon stoppers in the past, but they don't always fit well and will often pop out in the refrigerator from the gas pressure in the champagne. This stopper has worked perfectly so far. It screws into the bottle and seems to expand as it goes in, so it can fit different bottle sizes. We haven't had it pop out a single time, and the champagne stays carbonated for days. It adds very little additional height to the bottle so the bottle can still be stood upright in the fridge."

     "name": "What a handy kitchen tool! Previously I've used the plug-style stoppers for wine and champagne--they work alright for wine, but the carbonation of champagne causes the plugs to pop out, ruining the champagne.\nThis sealer cranks down on the bottle such that it doesn't release under the carbonation pressure from the champagne. I've had no problems with it. Taking the advice of other reviewers, I do not overdo it when tightening it onto a bottle. Apparently it's possible to break the sealer by overdoing it, but I haven't run into this. Also, it has fit the vast majority of the bottle types I've tried so far."

You get some oxidation, but for a pretty cheap tool that requires no nitrogen it works great. Just insert into the bottle neck and twist until it's tight. To remove, untwist and hear that comforting hiss that tells you it still has plenty of bubbles. No fancy equipment, no bubble destroying vacuum pumps, no hard to attach snap tops. I've bought them for friends who also love them.\nIf you're looking for an easy solution to keep a partial bottle of champagne for a few days, this one is highly recommended."

     "name": "The Metrokane Sealer is a real pressure seal that is simple to put on any glass bottle containing a carbonated beverage. It is much easier than pounding a cork back into the throat of bottle, and a much better seal. Its attractive to boot.\nAfter you have drunk some portion of a carbonated beverage, the Metrokane Sealer will seal off the remaining beverage from the atmosphere and hold that seal even as pressure rebuilds inside the bottle. Pressure will always rebuild because carbon dioxide outgasses from the liquid into the space above the liquid. The more highly carbonated the beverage, the higher the final pressure inside the bottle after re-sealing.\nRemember, even with a real pressure seal, like the Metrokane sealer, your beverage will lose some \"fizz\" as carbon dioxide moves out of the beverage and into the space above the beverage (\"head space\"). The bigger the space above the bottle, the more fizz your beverage will lose ... even with a pressure seal!\nDoes anyone know of a way to eliminate \"head space\"?"

     "name": "Although this is a great champagne stopper, I bought it hoping to use it with trappist beers. Trappist beers are usually sold in 24oz bottles and they are champagne corked. If you don’t want to drink the whole bottle, it’s hard to keep the remainder from going flat. The bottle rims are not quite the same as champagne bottles so the traditional champagne stoppers just don’t work. Additionally, flip lever stoppers don’t expand wide enough to seal the bottle,\nThis thing actually does the trick. You simply turn the knob on top and the stopper continues to expand until it is tight inside the bottle opening. These are the best stoppers I have found since they expand to fit most any bottle opening.\nI bought two but will probably pick up a couple more."

It was advertised as having a filter, in the past, when we bought these from various wine stores, no mention was made of a filtering capability.

As it pours out, it is aeriating the red wine and really taking it up a notch.

I wash them prior to use and rewashed them just to be sure they were not dirty and that may have been causing the dripping, Called the manufacturer and she instructed me to was them again because she was sure that was the problem. So I put them in the dishwasher and washed them again per her instructions- They still drip. She requested I send them back for inspection. Sorry can't do that the cost of shipping and return would out weigh the cost of the product so I am just retuning them to Amazon. You may have better luck and get a set that does not drip (my only problem with them) but if you don't the only way to get you money back for the defective product is through Amazon not the manufacturer.

The filter is porous enough so that the wine doesn't get too much air (if you want to decant a wine decant it, and most do not need decanting, especially new world wines).\nNote these are BPA free, made out of medical grade silicon.

They fit perfectly in the wine bottles and barely protrude above the bottle top, so they fit perfectly in my refrig. My one disappointment is that the Corker is too narrow for oil and vinegar bottles. The fit is so loose it practically falls out when the bottle it tipped, causing the oil or vinegar to spill."

I just wish they made a 4 pack with 2 black and 2 red ones. The red are a bit hard to come by but I always use them for my red wine. And the low profile height when closed makes it easier to store the bottle back in the fridge."

Once I compared the wine with and without Haley's corker I was sold. Bought one that day, took it to a party, and the person that poured the last glass threw the bottle away with the corker on top. Theses are black so it is easy to do. They do sell colored ones but cold not get the same price. So I found them on here at the same price for 4 as what I paid for 1 at the winery."

    {
     "name": "If you don't need a filter for sediment or precipitate, these are great. We have 4 that we bought previously for their other features, which are excellent. But, their \"filter\" is a joke. And, it was the need for filtering that prompted us to be this set. It was advertised as having a filter, in the past, when we bought these from various wine stores, no mention was made of a filtering capability. If you don't need to filter anything smaller than occasional cork chunks, these will be fine. But if you want actually filter out something smaller, buy something else."
    },
    {
     "name": "We discovered these while out wine tasting in Napa. If the wineries are using these, you know they've got to be great. I've bought them twice now as friends keep asking me if they can have one after seeing it in use. The best part is their aeriation for red wine. As it pours out, it is aeriating the red wine and really taking it up a notch. And, there is a small screen inside right before the pour spout that will filter out any cork debris or bottom sediment which is an added bonus. A definite buy item! And great for gifting too!"

    {
     "name": "I have used the product in the past and I am still very happy with my original set. They do every thing I need them to do - seal the bottle and not drip when I pour a glass of wine. The new set I received drip every time I used them. I wash them prior to use and rewashed them just to be sure they were not dirty and that may have been causing the dripping, Called the manufacturer and she instructed me to was them again because she was sure that was the problem. So I put them in the dishwasher and washed them again per her instructions- They still drip. She requested I send them back for inspection. Sorry can't do that the cost of shipping and return would out weigh the cost of the product so I am just retuning them to Amazon. You may have better luck and get a set that does not drip (my only problem with them) but if you don't the only way to get you money back for the defective product is through Amazon not the manufacturer. Thank you Amazon for standing up for what is sold on your site. ."

I really think the wine tasted better, too.\nWhen it came time to take this off the empty bottle of wine, I had to wait for the bottle to get to room temperature to get it out. That's how tightly sealed it gets!\nI will be getting these as gifts to all my wine lovers!"

     "name": "I purchased these for a holiday party for ease of a 'festive' look with the red color\nI liked the ease of use, however, I gave it only 4 stars based on a review I read about being able to lay bottle on side. We knew we'd have limited fridge space in the event we had any leftover wine. So based on the review that stated they were able to store on the bottle side, and nothing leaked, I purchased the product. It didn't work for us. We made sure to have the stopper securely in two bottles we needed to store in drawer of fridge. We were disappointed to find BOTH bottles of wine without the stopper in the bottles, creating a huge mess to clean up after. just beware of that potential hazard."
    },
    {
     "name": "I bought 2 sets of these. I’m very surprised by the high rating. They fill up with water, the metal at the top keeps coming out. They get mold/bacteria growing in them because the metal doesn’t stay in. These are the worst."
    },
    {
     "name": "I purchased these stoppers as the description stated that they were dishwasher safe. Although I washed them in the top rack of the dishwasher, the metal ornamental piece started to pop off after several weeks of use. It happened to all of the stoppers. Mold was growing inside the cavity between the silicone and the metal piece, so couldn't continue to use them.\nI wish they were made of seamless single piece of silicone, and it would have worked. These stoppers are good looking and easy to use, so I was hoping they would work...too bad."
    },
    {
     "name": "First world problems for sure, but I had had trouble finding a wine stopper/saver that allowed for the wine bottle to fit in the fridge when in use. Other wine stoppers were too tall. I don't have a fancy or special fridge, and even though the shelves are adjustable, I didn't want to adjust shelving (and lose height space on other shelves) for a wine bottle. These stoppers fit nice and low on the bottle, they are easier to put in and pull out, and they do a great job saving the wine. Two thumbs up!"
    },
    {
     "name": "Sadly, the stoppers I received have not worked properly. The first two I used leaked out just a bit, enough to drip out when the bottles are laying on their side in the wine fridge. The third one I used after I poured one glass of wine last night. Between the time I put the stopper in and placed the bottle and back in the wine fridge and the time I got home from work this evening, all except the wine that couldn't escape because it was laying on its side escaped the bottle to the bottom of the fridge and onto the floor. What a mess it made! I have used similar stoppers and never had the issues as I've had with these. Third time was a charm for me and I threw them all in the trash."
    },
    {
     "name": "These were cheap and you get a little more than you pay for. They are not very strong, and I would not suggest expecting them to keep your wine from spilling. However, they do block the air and bugs from getting in your bottle. I would suggest use them at a party when you need to just keep it closed in between glasses, it will work fine. However, I wouldn't suggest it to keep for more than a day or so."
    },
    {
     "name": "Unlike the cork stoppers that come with the bottle, these silicone stoppers will fit into the wine bottle time after time without any problems going in or removing them. Then can also be washed and reused hundreds of times. I thought they might be a bit small for the larger bottles of wine I purchase, but they are perfect just the way they are. They seal well and are so easy to remove and replace into the bottle I love them."
    },
    {
     "name": "Easy to use. Great as a wine cork. Terrible that it keeps water trapped inside when you wash it, pretty soon you begin brewing your own vintage tap water inside of it that occasionally spits out when you shake it, quite disgusting."
    },
    {
     "name": "This has a tighter fit than any other wine stopper I've tried -even the kind they sell at Bevmo and similar stores! It kept my sparkling wine carbonated for 3 days and regular wine tastes nearly as fresh as when first opened two days later. Absolutely recommend and I love that you get 5 for the price."
    },
    {
     "name": "These work great for sealing a partially used wine bottle. My wife and I usually have a glass of wine in the evening and re-sealing the bottle with the original cork in a giant pain. These stoppers seal the bottle very well. Great price."

     "name": "Bought a pack of 10 wine bottle stoppers and THEY ARE JUNK.\nThe first one I used was on a bottle of champagne and as I'm pressing the lever down to seal the bottle, the stopper exploded with parts flying right past my eye and landing all over the kitchen floor & counter, and the shaft with the silicone seal bobbing around inside the bottle.\nThe second one I tried seemed to work (as I shielded it with one hand while pressing the lever down with the other hand).\nThe third stopper I tried on a bottle of wine, and similar to the first stopper, it snapped/broke at the top with the small cross-bar/rod bending in half like a horseshoe, similar to the photo posted in another review.\nIn my experience so far, THESE ARE CHEAP PIECES OF CRAP, and I'll be looking for higher quality stoppers.\n(FWIW: I bought 2 wine stoppers, in this same design/style, at a liquor store many years ago and they still work. I'm only looking at replacing them because the rubber stopper portion has become very discolored and somewhat hardened over time. But the overall quality of that pair of stoppers versus this set of 10 is like Night & Day).\nI RECOMMEND LOOKING FOR HIGHER QUALITY STOPPERS."
    },
    {
     "name": "I bought it because it looked good and value of the money. 1st one broke after a couple of uses on one bottle. I think the second one is going to break soon. Please look at the photo uploaded. The metal bar is bending.\nThe seller should let the manufacturer know and to improve the hardness of the small metal bar. Otherwise every body is not happy. Please do your best to make customers happy and their money worthy."
    },
    {
     "name": "This may work well for wine bottles, but for some bottles where the bottle opening has a super short neck, like Bundaberg Ginger Beer, the rings on the 2 ring variety has the top ring too toward the middle to seal - you need to hold the stopper partly up off the bottle to get the ring to engage in the bottle neck. (the 1 ring variety has equally no chance). So getting these to work on bottles with short necks is problematic.\nBut for full neck bottles, you can insert the stopper fully, then close the lever and it seals."
    },
    {
     "name": "Well we bought as stocken stuffers for the family. They seal really good. Seem to be of decent quality and kept the champagne bubbles flowing all of New Year's Eve. Nice group of functional stoppers."

    },
    {
     "name": "These do not stay in the wine bottle. I have tried on several and they are too small to make a firm seal. In fact, they don't seal at all. Nothing seems to happen when the lever is pulled down."
    },
    {
     "name": "My prior ones had a softer lever action, but the dishwasher melted them enough that they needed to be replaced.\nThis set was near the price I paid for 2 maybe 10 years ago, so they are a fantastic value"

     "name": "Most of them worked just fine. They are a little stiff. I have had similar ones in the past that were smoother to close"
