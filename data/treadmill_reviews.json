Ha le rotelle, dunque puÃ² essere riposto comodamente sotto al letto, abbassando la barra per reggersi, oppure piegato in verticale, perÃ² un pochino pesa (io sono una donna, seppur allenata, in ogni caso si riesce a fare). Ã silenzioso e soprattutto non mi dÃ  l'idea di \"accrocco\", paragonandolo agli attrezzi che si trovano in palestra. Infatti ho preferito spendere un pochino di piÃ¹ per avere ampiezza del tappeto (avevo letto di altri in vendita su Amazon che hanno un tappetino in cui a malapena ci entrano i piedi!) e anche la barra di sostegno ad una giusta altezza. Ordinato domenica, mi Ã¨ arrivato oggi, martedÃ¬, in anticipo di 4 giorni e in soli 2 giorni, quindi! Praticamente Ã¨ giÃ  montato, l'unica cosa, mi raccomando, il pulsante di accensione Ã¨ sotto al tappeto (da nessuna parte nelle istruzioni ciÃ² Ã¨ indicato). Per il resto, lo consiglio e straconsiglio!! (Guardando la foto, considerate che io ho il 36 di misura di piedi :D perÃ² il tappeto in ogni caso Ã¨ ampio)"

Personnellement j'ai pris l'option avec la barre de maintien qui est trÃ¨s pratique pour l'Ã©quilibre et l'assurance (j'ai 66 ans). Je l'utilise pour la marche le choix des vitesses est amplement suffisant, (pour ma part 6km/h). Il y a un systÃ¨me pour la lubrification, il ne faut rien dÃ©monter.\nEn conclusion, trÃ¨s satisfait de ce produit que je recommande pour la marche.

     "name": "Premetto mai usato un tapis rouland prima d'ora, amavo fare lunghe passeggiate, ma una fastidiosa tallonite mi ha limitato l'autonomia, per cui ho pensato all'acquisto di un attrezzo che mi consentisse di fermarmi se il dolore diventa troppo fastidioso. Lo uso da circa una settimana e sono veramente soddisfatta dell'acquisto fatto in presenza di uno sconto veramente interessante, poco ingombrante, pedana utile piuttosto confortevole (42x109 cm la pedana), ingombro totale molto contenuto, facilissima l'installazione (unica cosa da sapere che a fianco del cavo di alimentazione c'Ã¨ un interruttore da accendere) e facile da ripiegare se non lo si vuole tenere aperto. Quando si spegne non si ferma di botto ma decresce la velocitÃ  per qualche secondo, poco rumoroso, ottimo per chi.vuole camminare. Per la corsa non so, non credo sia l'ottimo, la velocitÃ  massima del mio modello Ã¨ 6km (per me va bene non sono giovanissima), ma della stessa ditta ce ne sono a 8km e forse anche piÃ¹ veloci. Io riesco benissimo a camminare anche senza l'ausilio della barra e a simulare l'andatura del nordic walking con l'ausilio delle braccia. Vorrei provare con degli elastici legati alla barra (da provare perchÃ© non deve chiudersi) o alle ruotine per vedere di aumentare lo sforzo delle braccia, ma ancora non l'ho fatto. Io mi sento di raccomandare questo TR, unica cosa verificate il modello di cui avete bisogno, su Amazon ne stanno comparendo molti!"

     "name": "Il miglior articolo acquistato nel 2020.\nConsegna super rapida (stimata 2 settimane, arrivata dopo 2 giorni).\nArriva giÃ  montato e con nastro lubrificato, bisogna solo utilizzarlo appena tolto dalla scatola.\nAltezza sul punto massimo 12cm precisi (indispensabile per me che ho un letto a 12,5 cm... Entra perfettamente sotto).\nAbbastanza silenzioso, ottimo per la corsa leggera a 8 km/ora e per le camminate.\nCol bluetooth integrato le canzoni dalle casse hanno un suono niente male, magari il volume poteva essere piÃ¹ alto ma comunque si sente perfettamente (e di sicuro meglio che dal cellulare).\nLa lubrificazione automatica Ã¨ la ciliegina sulla torta: quando c'Ã¨ bisogno si accende una spia che ricorda di aggiungere il lubrificante, sul lato superiore sinistro della base câÃ¨ un piccolo tappo arancione che copre il buco dove inserirlo (nella confezione Ã¨ incluso un flaconcino da 15 ml), nelle istruzioni comunque c'Ã¨ scritto tutto il procedimento.\nIl poggiamani si apre e chiude in 2 secondi, e ha tutte le funzioni che servono. Il coperchio per i pulsanti riesce a tenere un cellulare (ha anche un filo di gomma antiscivolo), anche se purtroppo i tablet non li regge. Ã presente anche un telecomando, volendo, se non si vuole usare i comandi sul manubrio.\nLa larghezza del nastro Ã¨ assolutamente perfetta, per me che sono alto 182cm (di meno sarebbe stato davvero troppo poco).\nNonostante abbia le rotelline posteriori, durante la camminata o la corsa non si sposta di un millimetro, e risulta stabile e il passo ammortizzato.\nLo uso tutti i giorni almeno 45/60 minuti continuativi e non fa una piega.\nInsomma... Con questo prezzo davvero non potevo chiedere di meglio!"

Bis ca. 60 kg Gewicht wahrscheinlich schon aber mit 100+ kg traue ich ihm nicht zu, aber will es auch nicht testen.\nKleine Fernbedienung klappt sehr gut aber nicht nÃ¶tig.

     "name": "As the title says I was incredibly impressed after using this this treadmill the last 48 hours. I don't always write reviews mainly because I'm a very blunt and harsh critic and also a detailed perfectionist. Very few products will actually inspire me to do a review and only on the extreme end of either very good or terrible product. I can say with full confidence this is a five star product and I am pleasantly surprised and happy with my purchase. I will now list all the reasons that I checked and how I came to my final rating.\n1. Unboxing- True to the claim on the webpage that the treadmill was preinstalled and didn't need any bolting screw driving or any other outside mechanical items. In the past with other treadmills companies they usually claim this but in my experience I have found there is always at least one to or sometimes multiple items that I need to install just to get the machine working. Not in this case!!\n2. instructions Manual- Small size - The instructions were very thorough and concise with pictures and very easy to read and even the editing/grammar was flawless. usually ding two or 3 stars simply just if the instruction manual is not coherent in its instructions. It took me about 3 minutes to read the instructions from front to back and that is also the last half of the manual was showing how to keep the maintenance and they even give lubrication bottle for two maintain the track belt. As for the instructions it was step-by-step on how to set it up with no confusion or incoherent jargon that other instruction manuals fall prey too with other different treadmill products. Honestly it took me about 3 minutes to read (front to back) and I was actively looking for flaws so another person would take shorter time.\n2. Setup- It does take less than 60 seconds to get this machine up and running. I timed it at 36 seconds on my stopwatch for my first time. I thought at first I had made a mistake because of how simple and easy the process was that I went back to the instructions just to see if I missed anything. Nope everything was in order and it's literally that simple!\n3. Safety- There is a bright red/orange magnetic cord that you clip onto your shirt or shorts which in case you fall/trip it will immediately turn off the treadmill so no further damage will happen. I stimulated falling and tripping several times to test the cord and it worked perfectly.\n4. Operation - Wow! It really is silent. Let me reiterate it is the most silent treadmill I've ever experienced in the last 14 years. Running was smooth and how the design is with the bottom of the treadmill having a gap in the middle on the floor has easily been a comfortable experience. Usually my knees ache on most treadmills even with super expensive treadmills that I have tried in the past; but not this time. This alone justified the low price of the treadmill as other treadmills which are easily double the price don't come anywhere close to the comfort I've had on this treadmill.\n5. Customer support- I wanted to test how active and responsive this company was since I had never used them before. I call it usually a practice run just in case if something ever happened I could see how the company reacts before a possible problem ever occurred. Usually customer support for most companies are pretty substandard in my opinion but not this Advenor company. I got same day responses and excellent customer service and I could see based on their professionalism that they are company that is customer driven to be happy with their product.\nConclusion- Wow this is without a doubt the first review that I would actually give six stars if it was possible instead of the limit of five on Amazon. Seriously don't waste money on other old company brands of treadmills that sell you super priced features and shoddy quality. This Advenor Treadmill is worth every penny and I am supremely happy with my purchase. 6 STARS!!!"

     "name": "I received this foldable treadmill today and I could not wait to unpack it! The treadmill was lightweight and easy to setup by myself with back problems. I had the complete setup within 20 minutes or less. The display was very bright and the buttons were easily accessed. I appreciated the slim fit of this treadmill as I had limited space to work with in my garage. Even though it is slim fit and light it packs a PUNCH with allowing me to power walk. I highly recommend this wonderful treadmill for a great home workout! Iâm excited!!!"

     "name": "Really love this machine so far! I work in a very quiet cubicle space with 15 or so others. This treadmill is super easy to use, works great and is actually pretty quiet! Only the people right next to me can hear anything. The motor doesnât make any noise, but there is some light sound from the belt moving and my actual walking. It beeps loudly multiple times when starting and once when you change speeds, which is a little annoying. But once you get going, the only sound is from the belt and walking. When I received it, I was able to remove it from the box myself and wheel it into position. Itâs not overly heavy. Simply plug it in and itâs ready to go. Instructions say to apply silicone lubricant beneath the belt beforehand. There is no application hole, so I just squeezed some of the provided lubricant under the belt on both sides. The remote takes AAA batteries, which were surprisingly included. I have used it 2-3 hours each day while I worked. Itâs very easy to get used to, and doesnât affect my ability to type or get work done. While walking, the display rotates between 1) distance walked, 2) calories burned, and 3) time spent on the machine. The feet on the machine do create an indentation in the carpet, so you may want to consider a mat underneath. The speed goes from 0 to 6 in .5 increments. I walk comfortably at 3.5 or 4 and can start breaking a light sweat after 20-30 minutes. You might want to consider a small fan to have at your desk. The 6 speed would accommodate a very light jogging speed. With standard shipping, it arrived 12 days from the date I placed the order. Very pleased with this purchase so far. Now Iâm just hoping it lasts a decent amount of time since Iâll be using it frequently!"

    },
    {

There are no instructions for the app in the user's manual and there is no way for the treadmill to be picked up by bluetooth as the app describes.\nThis is a scam product, probably scam app, and should not be purchased. It appears this USED to be legit- I read a lot of reviews - but something has recently changed. They used to only have 6% negative review feedback and now have over 50% negative in the last 30 days with numerous people reporting the same unsolved problems."

It has a smaller tread base in length and width than my old one, but works great. I did not want a lot of whistles and bells, but this one is what I would call a ladies size. The only thing I would change would be a little higher hand rail but that is all. Not for the big and tall. I am 5'6\" and this treadmill is great for me."

To recommend the product, I would tell those who buy it with the guarantee, Amazon is excellent and punctual"

I like that its light weight and can easily be moved around. I don't like that you have to screw and unscrew to fold the treadmill up, but its size easy that it's more of a irritant than a negative mark. It seems like a very sturdy machine and like others reviews it is great for shorter people, I'm 5'1 and it's the perfect height for me. Overall, I think I'm really going to like it and the price was great at well."

    {
     "name": "First off I wanna say that their customer support is amazing. When I received my treadmill the incline function wasnât working. I contacted them and they apologized and inform me that the treadmill had a self repair function. They showed me how to do to everything and answered all my questions.\nI really like the simple layout of the control panel. Other treadmills have a huge amount of buttons and it feels really cluttered but the simple layout of this treadmill makes it really easy to use and manage all the functions. I also love that this treadmill completely folds unlike other treadmills that partially fold. Itâs really compact when folded and really quiet too. Another reason I purchased this treadmill was because after shopping around and comparing different treadmills this was the only folding treadmill that is able to do 9mph and have the automatic incline function. This features are hard to find in folding treadmills and in my opinion are must features, specially the automatic incline. Overall after using this treadmill for a couple of runs and walks, Iâm really impressed and I think that itâs a great treadmill and a good buy if your considering purchasing one."

If you have been doing a lot of research on treadmills, look no further\n1) Goes to higher speeds than most treadmills of comparable price\n2) Very quiet\n3) Very compact when folded\n4) has automatic inclines (VERY HARD TO FIND AT THIS PRICE)\nI am so happy I did not pay more for a name brand machine. This machine has everything that I need at an affordable price. Thank you!"

Not sure why it didn't show up previously in my hundreds of searches, so very grateful! Customer support is also responsive- another plus!\nWill update my review if anything changes but for now- I'm pleased as punch!"

     "name": "This was a great purchase. Spent a week straight hunting for the right affordable treadmill. Below is a list of things I was personally looking for in a treadmill, and this has passed all those marks:\n-can reach at least 7mph\n-a belt wide enough to run on\n-simple interface the whole family could use\n-easy folding\n-cupholders\n-comfortable treadway, for even the most worn out joints\n-does not shake like there's an earthquake when in use\n-under $400\nI don't do video reviews often so sorry about the repetitive speech.\nIf you're hunting for that affordable treadmill, you're seeing all these neat luxuries on more expensive ones that you think you need. For example:\n-bluetooth speakers [you probably own better bluetooth speakers, or will use headphones]\n-video screen/special FX [you're there to get fit, not enjoy a matinee]\n-High inclines [beneficial but not necessary]\nYeah, you don't need all that nonsense\nThis took me 30 minutes to assemble by myself. Instructions are poorly written, but there were NOT many pieces\nI gave this 4 stars because I cut myself on a piece that was broken and jutting out, which is the equivalentof being slapped by someone you just met.\nThe screen can be difficult to view and the cupholders are poorly placed. The system has limited memory--not much return function so keeping track of things can be difficult. The preset workouts are very odd and not well balanced at all.\nDespite that, I strongly recommend this treadmill"

    {
     "name": "So far so good it was easy to assemble with a lil bit of muscle to help. I truly like the size of the machine Iâm 5 feet 145lbs itâs perfect for me. I bought this specific machine because of the belt size. Other machines belts were 12.5 wide this one is 17. If your looking for equipment on a budget this is the winner!"

Im 5'9 and it fits me well and is sturdy when I did a slight jog."

I usually hit the sides on full-size mills and this was a + for us\nð Simple functional screen with the workout details. (Calories, distance, time, speed, etc. are all included)\nð Easy to operate the folding mechanism\nð Quick enough to jog/run on it\nð The screen is hard to see at certain angles. If you're 5' tall, this is not a problem. It has that type of digital screen where you have to be angled just right to be able to read it. At this price, the screen could be better."

This treadmill is great for that. Easy to assemble as well, my 16 year old son put it together quite easily.

I received it about 2 weeks ago and had no problem assembling it. I use it primarily to walk on in the winter months or if the weather is not conducive to walk outside. I set my own pace and time. I have tried a couple of pre-programed settings but they either go too slow or too fast during the workout. Of course, you can manually adjust the speed any time. There is an adjustment for a slight incline on the machine. The controls are conveniently located. I found some damage to the plastic by the handles of the treadmill when received but it did not affect the use of it. So far I am very pleased with this treadmill."

     "name": "I am upgrading my review from a zero to a 4. Reasons:\n1) Instructions are close to impossible to follow, not clear at all, and in the link they send you can't really see what he's doing.\n2) It is very heavy, you need 2 people to put it together.\n3) Once we finally got it put together (even though some parts didn't really match up correctly) the tread started to move back and forth, and we had to adjust it multiple times - a LOT of work putting it together!\n4) Runs great so far. If that changes I will re-review it."

It is very easy to use. It has programs in it from 1-7, it is great for indoor workout. The incline does not really change from flat much. I recommend this product!"

     "name": "I'm 5 ft 4 inch tall and weigh about 140 lbs. This little machine is perfect for me to go on a run when the weather isn't permitting. It's small, fits in tight places, and works like a charm. HOWEVER it says it fits up to 220 pounds and I call BS on that. My husband is 6ft 5 inch and weighs 210. The machine literally bends when he runs on it. The sound it makes is scary. Every time he gets on it I am afraid he's going to put his foot right through the middle of it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone over 6ft or maybe 180lbs?"

     "name": "At this price, I expected much less of a machine. I have used it several times and it has exceeded my expectations. It is sturdy and quiet. There is almost no motor noise. The base is a bit shorter than treadmills I am accustomed to, but my stride fits fine. I am 5'7\" and find the panel a bit too short, but beyond that, this treadmill is perfect. It is heavy-- getting it upstairs required 2 people. Once I got it opened though, it was easy to put together. The safety switch and pre-set programs are nice options, and ones I would have expected in a more expensive treadmill. I researched many treadmills in this price range, and am happy with this purchase."

I accidentally put the treadmill on an incline while doing the assembly and was wondering why just walking was a bit of a struggle. Finally figure it out and fixed it. Workout are a lot easier now. My daughter and I both use it at least twice a day. The arm handles could be a bit wider apart but I am able to deal with it. Sometimes I accidentally stop my workouts due to the button on the arm handles that control the start and stop. Overall I really like the treadmill and have been using it about a month"

     "name": "I received my treadmill a lot earlier than estimated which was super nice, but when I looked at the package you can tell it was not taken care of through the shipping process... not sellers fault. Upon opening the package I notice a crack in the left handle (pictured) which I notice by some others reviews it was the same handle and place my crack was on thereâs. Isnât that big of an issue for me doesnât affect the treadmill at all or bother me... I would LOVE to give this a 5 start rating because the treadmill is super sturdy, Iâve had no issues with it running and it was super easy putting it together. BUT the reason why I rated 3 stars and not 5 is because I bought this because of the covid that lift and lower factor of the treadmill and unfortunately I canât not lift mine. (Pictured) you can see that my treadmill is lopsided when it is lifted for some reason, the handle stops it from being lifted and when I push up really hard it does go past but then the orange incliner part completely stops it from being lifted. Thereâs no way to push it up anymore around the plastic piece. Hoping the company will reach out to help me fix the problem."

Either I am too lazy to drive there or I am always so tired after work. I don't have any motivation. So I just wanted to give a try for this treadmill. I did all research on this brand---Echanfit before I purchased it.\nFirst, one thing really caught my eyes is the treadmill can be folded. It saves me a lot of space. I can put it away easily when I am done using it. Perfect for my home. Second, the handle arms has speed control, I don't need to use the screen and the running machines supposed to be quiet. Third, they provide 24/7 customer service. So that is why I choose this treadmill.\nLet me tell you about my experience..\nIt takes about two weeks for me to receive the package. No damaged, the treadmill is in a good condition. It is well made and sturdy. No complaints. It does take two people to assemble because someone has to hold the console piece while you connect with one of the wire. It took me 30 minutes to finish up. There is a switch at the bottom in the front that turns on the treadmill after you plugging it into the wall. I would say It is pretty easy and simple to assemble. It comes with a large LCD display and 15 pre-set programs just as the website describe. I can monitor the correct time data for each exercise. I am 6 feet and 150 pounds. It works perfectly for me for home exercise. I can run anytime I want at home. I can run anywhere I want because it is foldable I can easily move around. I am extremely happy with this purchased."

I didn't want something big and bulky, or too sleek that it's flimsy, and this treadmill is perfect.\nIt comes already put together in the box. You just have to add 2 screws and a lock-pin and that's it.\nThe directions are clearly written by someone who speaks a different language, but it's still clear enough to figure it out. What they don't spell out in the instructions, and is buried in a bunch of fine print is the belt lubricant. Just lift up each side and squeeze it under the belt from top to bottom, and then turn on and let run for 5 minutes and you're good to go.\nI didn't need to tighten or loosen the belt at all, it worked great right out of the box, with no skipping or lagging.\nAll in all, this is a great treadmill to lose a few of those pesky quarantine pounds on. It gets 2 thumbs up from me for ease of use, sturdiness, size, and simplicity."

    {
     "name": "Overall a decent treadmill for the price. Its not too noisy. The quality looks decent the only thing is if your 5\"10 like me you do feel like your towering over it but its fine. It folds nicely and small even though it couldnt fit under my bed it takes up little space as you can see i squeezed it into our small bedroom. It was easy set up straight out of the box. Everything much is manual. Lightweight and can be moved easily.One thing i dont like is once you start a workout you cant PAUSE and come back."

I needed something affordable to keep active during my busy schedule as well as something with a high weight limit and this was exactly what I needed. Took less than 10 mins to put together (longest part was taking it out the box-a little on the heavy side). Being that I keep it in my guest room its super easy to fold up and put in the closet. Totally worth every penny!"

     "name": "We were looking a compact foldable treadmill that was affordable and we found just that! This treadmill was easy to assemble less than 10 minutes to put together and it was perfect for my family to all use during this pandemic! Worth the buy so far so good! I did purchase the insurance that comes with this treadmill if for any reason this machine malfunctions but so far itâs been very useful and worth the buy!"

I bought it to use in conjunction with long walks to help keep myself fit during this lockdown. It folds away nicely to fit in a cupboard out of the way and when I want to use it I can take out and set up within a couple of minutes. I find the resistance settings really good for my beginner level, and so far it's been an excellent way to increase my fitness levels and strength in my legs. I would 100% recommend this treadmill to anyone looking to lose weight and who doesn't feel comfortable in the gym or in public to do so.\nRunning 5k a day I have managed to lose 1 stone in 10 days, unbelievable and could not have done it without this treadmill! I will be saving money to add to my collection of Himimi, extremely good quality and value for money. In my eyes this is worth every single penny!"

Compact, does not require too much space, so I keep it unfolded. Love that it can be folded away and opened out within seconds - you just unscrew, open out and screw again. Cons: - was a bit fiddly to set up but just follow instructions. Nice smooth action once you get the hang of it.\nI bought it for walking, but my kids have tried it too, so I can say it's definitely good at high speed running! If you're looking for something that is budget friendly and helps get those steps in safely, I'd recommend this."

     "name": "Customer service was helpful in resolving an issue with the shipping on this item, though they did initially confuse my order with a different treadmill which had supposedly been damaged during transit. While my product did arrive late, it was still intact at least. The product sits at a slight incline, which affords a more intense workout experience; however, the highest speed setting provided is a 6.0, which differs wildly from that of a larger, more powerful machine found at the local gym. With my long legs I can speed walk up to a pace of roughly 5.0 with this treadmill, which would be a good solid run on a similar machine at any recreation center with state of the art equipment. Itâs a relatively compact and lightweight contraption, easily moved from one room to the next when company is expected. I do wish the machine had some sort of shelf attached to it up top, to help hold a smartphone or iPad securely when in use. Overall, I would recommend this product."

Iâve been concerned about the motor blowing out based on previous reviews, but so far this works for me. If you want to put your phone in the cup holder, Iâd suggest you have a smaller phone if you still want to be able to see the screen.

I wish it was easier.\nI read some reviews saying it was hard to assemble and the manual wasn't really clear...it literally took me less than 15 mins to assemble the whole thing and the manual has simple pictures with labeled item numbers telling you where to place them.\nOverall, I would recommend, it was a great purchase and my mom and I have been using it everyday and it's been running well (I use it for about an hour switching between walking, jogging and running)."

     "name": "During this period of Covid-19 and with our public gyms and fitness centers closed, it is difficult exercising as before. I tried walking but I felt I needed a more rigorous program. With limited space at home, exercise equipment is not practical. However, I found this particular treadmill, a smaller version of the traditional treadmill and it fits perfectly in an empty space in my bedroom. It really requires no installation outside of tightening some bolts and its ready to go. I had visions of storing it under the bed when not in use but this did not work because when folded it doesn't fit. Therefore I leave it in the open position and it's ready whenever I am. While it doesn't give you various settings found on the traditional treadmills, you can set the speed as it does register the distance and time which is all I need. It's a great addition and am very pleased with it.\nDuring this difficult time, it helps keep an exercise regimen in the comfort of your home and I would recommend it most highly."

My advice is buy a safety key when you order this so you donât run into the same problem Iâm having."

It is only good for walking as it is not very long and not especially sturdy for vigorous use. It doesnât incline so if u need that function this isnât the treadmill for you. I Have noticed that the walking pad has started shifting to one side which is concerning (if it continues). All that being said, for the money, it is compact, cute in the white and pink color, and reliable (so far) for a basic walking treadmill."

The bar is squeaky & slightly wobbly but not scary wobbly when holding on (book or tablet is a little fuzzy), you may want a sound mat for the thudding of the steps (I am on a vinyl/pergola type floor with only concrete under it which may be enhancing the sound). I'm enjoying getting a walk or run in w/o worry about weather/allergies."

     "name": "Just what I was looking for. Relatively quiet so it won't wake up my kids in the next room Fits perfectly under my desk so I can walk while working, I only give it 4 stars because the remote has no wrist band to use in case you drop the remote and the speeds are only in .5 increments (which is really fine since while working I don't do more than 2.5 but would be nice to maybe do 2.3). But those are the only complaints. Very lightweight. I roll to my bedroom in the evening when done working and continue walking there. I did buy a small mat to put under it as I have carpet. AND it arrived a e week early!! Put my Apple watch on my ankle and go!\nEDIT: itâs quiet at slower speeds. Remember itâs not a full-sized treadmill. So you will get some noise. I wouldnât run on it. I do that on my regular treadmill. This is just to get some walking in while working for me."

     "name": "I am seriously impressed with the customer service of this company and the treadmill was of better than expected quality.\nThe treadmill arrived exactly as described and It really is pretty much take it out of the box and you're done there is no assembly. Unfortunately I did not factor in a few things before my purchase that turned out to be pretty important.\nFirst, if you are older like me you may find that not having anything to hold on to when you are walking on a moving surface 6 inches above your floor is not really safe. I can do it but i found myself having to position the treadmill next to a wall to help my balance a little. I've used treadmills for years and love them and had no idea that not having those handrails would be an issue. I mean i walk all the time with no handrail right? That reasoning was flawed for obvious (now) reasons.\nSecond, and this was the issue that caused me to have to return this, if you are planning on moving this treadmill to 3 or 4 locations in your house some with carpet some with tile some with hardwood, you may end up having to re level the machine each time you move it to a new spot. This should have been obvious to me but was not for some reason. Don't get me wrong, the treadmill is great and made to be moved but maybe just from a storage spot to a use spot not all over the house and on different surfaces and carpets each time you use it. This is user error not the machines fault.\nIn the end the company helped me return the product and actually even arranged the pick up for me at any time that was convenient. Seriously? What company does that? So impressed! And the product was actually really nice too boot. If you are not planning on moving it all over your house and you are comfortable with no rails I would recommend this treadmill and this company."

I looked at the specs before I ordered it but, until you see this thing right in front of you, you just don't realize just how small it really is. Thank goodness my wife is barely over five feet tall and has a short stride or this treadmill would be useless.\nIt arrived slightly damaged but runs (and I'm trying to coordinate a replacement part for the damaged one with the seller) though the \"programs\" don't seem to work. The packing was very brittle styrofoam and was crushed into tiny, static-charged pieces that were a bit tough to clean up.\nIt doesn't REALLY fold up but the retaining bolts can be removed and THEN you can fold it though it is unstable unless you also remove the retaining bolts on the handle/control module and lay the whole thing flat.\nDon't buy this unless the user is a very small adult (or regular kid-sized)."

     "name": "As many other people have done since the outbreak of covid, I bought more exercise equipment. I wanted to be able to continue walking throughout the winter and I just wanted a basic treadmill. And for $200 that's what I got. On the description I was mislead to the fact that it was sturdy, when I try to pick up the pace and jog, the top half will start to wobble and shake. Also it stated that it was quiet, which it really isn't. It also says that the slope can be adjusted but there is nothing in the instructions that indicates how. Lastly I would also like to mention that it says 'miles' in the description, but when I turned it on it is set to kilometres. Like I said though, it is basic and it does serve its purpose despite the given description. So please make sure you do all the research possible before investing in something like this.\nTRAINING WITH HIGH PERFORMANCEã: Combining maximum performance, optimal comfort and ultimate efficiency, this 600W folding treadmill equipment for home use is a great assistance to reach your fitness goals. This professional fitness treadmill features a large running surface, built-in pulse sensor grips and an LED display console, helping track your speed, time, distance, pulse and calories well.\nðªãSTURDY AND ERGONOMIC BUILDã: Made of high-performance advanced materials, this folding running deck is undoubtedly sturdy and durable. Strong chassis and nonslip texture running belt help reduce impact on your joints as you exercise, supporting a maximum user weight of 220 lbs.\nðªãINNOVATIVE MODES AND ADJUSTABLE SPEEDã: Designed for both walking and running, this indoor treadmill can achieve speeds between 0.6 mph and 6.2 mph, which can be instantly changed by the on-console sensor button. Three modes as flat mode, climbing mode and mountaineering mode are available by adjusting the slope to meet your workout intensity.\nðªãENTERTAINMENT AND SAFETYã: BA device holder is also equipped for mounting your smart device to make your workout enjoyable. Comes with a safety key and close sensor button, the treadmill can be stopped immediately for safety guarantee.\nðªãFOLDING TRANSPORTATION AND EASY ASSEMBLEã: With portability in mind, the transportation wheels are designed to move the treadmill. And the folding design allows you to effortlessly store by turning the frame locks. Detailed operation and installation instructions are included for easy assembly and proper usage. Moreover, a cup holder is also attached for convenient use."

This is definitely a \"Starter\" treadmill and I am also very hesitant to test the weight as relayed at 300lbs max. It's very easy and out of the box assembly. Literally 6 side screws. It's not heavy like some have said I carried this to my basement and installed it by myself in about 20min. It's \"Ok\" for the price but I won't like I feel like I should have spent an extra $100 for something more sturdy. I don't see this lasting more than a year maybe 2 if I'm lucky and I certainly would NOT run on this. Strictly for walking. Another issue I have is the size ... despite my pics this is Small in width and length. I don't know what to tell ya but this is my review...it's not horrible but not the best either but I already spent $400+ bucks so I'll make the best of it for my he gym"

That means I can store or take it out wherever and whenever I want with the help of my family.This treadmill has different defult programs, speed levels and 3 manual incline Positions. Based on my experience, the speed of 0.6KM/h is suitable for the elderly and children to walk slowly, 1.5KM/h is good for jogging, and 2KM/h + for running.I compared to some other brands of treadmills and found that some of these required to download and configure their own applications before using them. However, this product has digital windows to show speed, time, heart rate, distance and calories intuitively without any APP. It is convenient and no technical difficulty for all ages who want to augment their daily outside walking and jogging. It is fully functional and easy to use.I used to work out at a gym, but didn't soldier on. I hope I can keep at it this time."

I wanted a treadmill, but was on a very tight budget and decided to chance it, and let me just say it is impressive. I was able to assemble this by myself in about 10 minutes, and there were six, count them six, screws to put into the holes and tighten-period. It took more effort for me to take the box to the trash then it did to assemble this. I am 230 pounds and thought that the belt would stutter with my weight even though there is a 300 pound limit. I stepped on, held my breath, and no stutter. The belt moved with no problem and it was very smooth. I would caution that the belt is not as long as some of the higher end models, but for the price point and convenience I say buy it; this is amazing."

Even though itâs manual, adjustment is super easy so thatâs a plus.\nAll in all definitely worth the money for me!\n(For context: Iâm only planning to use it for walking and light jogging since I canât run well due to medical issues.)"

The device itself is a little noisy, but not as bad once you go faster. I did 9 minute miles easily. The tread is narrow- this is a compact device. The control device is almost indecipherable- speeding up or slowing down and stopping are all that I can figure out. Don't buy this for the workout programs or raising or lowering pitch.\nHowever, its cheap, small, and seems to work well for non-speed effort runs, for a person my size.\nI am happy with this purchase, and hope the device lasts."

Do not recommend, don't waste your money, it was a 100% disappointing experience*\nIt was easy to assemble, low profile when disassembled, I was able to do it on my own with determination and a dolly. So far so good with the product itself, but I have only just opened it and as I was putting the screws in I noticed a sizeable chunk was missing from the base. This chunk now makes it possible for little fingers to be poked into the base of the tread and I can only guess by the large warning sign right beside the hole - this is bad. I'm disappointed I paid so much for a new product and received something damaged in a spot it really isn't okay to have damage. The entire thing was padded and I did not manhandle it, this was within the box damage. I cannot afford a return shipping cost for such a large item and waited most of a month for this item to arrive."

The big box sporting good stores had basic treadmill in stock but after carefully reading the reviews for this treadmill and the box store treadmill I decided to go with OMA. This treadmill has exceeded my expectations. I was nervous ordering this treadmill because I had never heard of the brand. I'm so happy I did. I weigh 288lbs and it is very sturdy and runs smoothly.

It came in well packed and undamaged, and It's very heavy and needs to be moved by two people. Its installation is really simple and just need to fix six nuts, so I finished it by myself.

It's not heavy like some have said I carried this to my basement and installed it by myself in about 20min. It's \"Ok\" for the price but I won't like I feel like I should have spent an extra $100 for something more sturdy. I don't see this lasting more than a year maybe 2 if I'm lucky and I certainly would NOT run on this. Strictly for walking. Another issue I have is the size ... despite my pics this is Small in width and length. I don't know what to tell ya but this is my review...it's not horrible but not the best either but I already spent $400+ bucks so I'll make the best of it for my he gym"

     "name": "I bought this treadmill a week ago. I used it a few times before writing this review.First of all, to my amazement, it is light enough for two person to move it around. That means I can store or take it out wherever and whenever I want with the help of my family.This treadmill has different defult programs, speed levels and 3 manual incline Positions. Based on my experience, the speed of 0.6KM/h is suitable for the elderly and children to walk slowly, 1.5KM/h is good for jogging, and 2KM/h + for running.I compared to some other brands of treadmills and found that some of these required to download and configure their own applications before using them. However, this product has digital windows to show speed, time, heart rate, distance and calories intuitively without any APP. It is convenient and no technical difficulty for all ages who want to augment their daily outside walking and jogging. It is fully functional and easy to use.I used to work out at a gym, but didn't soldier on. I hope I can keep at it this time."

     "name": "When deciding on a treadmill, I was reading the reviews and thought to myself, \"there is no way a treadmill is easy to assemble\". I wanted a treadmill, but was on a very tight budget and decided to chance it, and let me just say it is impressive. I was able to assemble this by myself in about 10 minutes, and there were six, count them six, screws to put into the holes and tighten-period. It took more effort for me to take the box to the trash then it did to assemble this. I am 230 pounds and thought that the belt would stutter with my weight even though there is a 300 pound limit. I stepped on, held my breath, and no stutter. The belt moved with no problem and it was very smooth. I would caution that the belt is not as long as some of the higher end models, but for the price point and convenience I say buy it; this is amazing."

The error code was \"E8\" Over load error - User may have exceeded max weight. The maximum weight for the product is listed as 250 lbs; my husband only weighs 150 lbs. Luckily, he was walking when the treadmill stopped; it would have been have very dangerous had he been running. On a regular basis, the treadmill now abruptly stops with this error after about 45 minutes of use. We called Best Choice Products customer support and were told this is a known issue, but because the warranty period had expired they would do nothing to remedy the problem.

I use one for my drink and the other for my phone. I can also rest my tablet on the magazine holder. And the color...Pink!! Need I say more? If you're looking for something small, easy to use and super cute...this may be the treadmill for you!"

     "name": "I decided to buy a cheaper treadmill because I'd just be using it walking while I watched TV to add to my exercises periodically throughout the week. Everyone thought I was crazy since we have treadmills in the basement of our apartment building, but I said the heck with it. Well, it turns out I use it far more than I ever thought! It's small enough that it fits into my LR well. I run 5-6 miles per day, 6 days a week on it & it's still going strong. Granted, I did buy the 2-yr warranty so that puts my mind at ease with the fact that I'm using the crap out of it. I find I like to run more often and in the evenings, so having this in my own place makes it super convenient to do so! It's true it doesn't incline at all, but I didn't want that feature going into it. It has convenient buttons on both handle-bars for heart-rate monitor and speed adjustment so works well for left-handed people as much as right-handed.\nThe only minor issue I've had with it so far is I periodically have to manually adjust the belt. It's super easy to do. I was more put-off by the fact that I had to continually adjust it as soon as I got it more so than having to do it at all. Since that first week of adjustments, I've only had to do it a handful of times so I call that a win. It still makes some odd noises sometimes, but runs just fine for what I need it to.\nI noticed before buying it that there were comments that this treadmill is ridiculously small. I can see where someone would say that (now, as far as it being only large enough for dogs... that's not true). I'm 5'3, fit, 120lbs (hopefully soon to be 110lb. with this bad boy) so it fits me just fine. However, if you are really overweight or tall, this wouldn't be the treadmill for you. The track is narrow and short. I have a short stride and it just about fits me so if you have a long stride from being taller, this wouldn't work for you.\nI'll be more than satisfied if this treadmill lasts me for 2 years considering the amount of use I'm putting it through. It's obvious that you're not going to get a highly innovative, comfortable, state-of-the-art treadmill you're used to at the gym for this price, but if you want a simple machine to keep you active for little investment, I highly recommend it.\nAn added bonus: I throw a narrow cardboard box across the bars and set my laptop on it to use as a temporary treadmill desk when I'm working longer hours at home."

     "name": "Good treadmill for the price (at the time of my purchase, it was a little less than two hundred with free shipping). I see it has gone up $10 since I bought it. IMO if it goes over two hundred, I would purchase a different treadmill that can withstand running on it. The treadmill is just as advertised. It's compact, which is exactly what I was looking for. It's not a running treadmill, but a fast walking treadmill, and for me, I'll be able to jog on it. My husband has a good stride when jogging and his stride is too long (wide?) for the length of the running belt. The running belt is 13 inches wide and 38 inches long. If you have a wide (long) stride, this probably isn't for you. I like everything about it, except the sound. For me, if it's not 'talking' to me or playing music, there is no reason for it to make noise. It does not have any feature that plays music, talks, or has a jack for mp3 players. The speakers are solely for the annoying beeping. With every incremental increase or decrease in speed, it makes a piercing beep. When turning off and on, it makes a series of loud beeps. For me, they are abnormally loud (compared to the soft beeps from the treadmills in the gym, for instance). I taped over the speakers, it dulled the sound a bit. The beeping noise would not deter me from purchasing this treadmill again, but it would be very nice if the audio was a feature I could turn off. It has two beverage holders which are generous in size. The media shelf for tablets, books, and phones is perfect. I have a touchscreen laptop and I can place it one the shelf without any noticeable vibration while I walk. It was easy to assemble. The display monitor is one unit (monitor plus handles). You do need two people to easy place it onto the treadmill. One person could do it, but it might be a bit tricky. It is bulky to store and not as easy as I thought it would be. When I remember to snap a photo of it stored upright, I'll update the review. All in all, I'm very pleased with it. I deducted one star due to the noisy beeping that doesn't have an option to turn it off."

     "name": "First off, I spent weeks going over reviews for treadmills that were on the cheaper side. I wanted something to use to run on in the winter- because in Michigan itâs cold most of the time. I didnât want to pay for a gym membership either.\nNow most of what I wanted was a simple treadmill that I could run/jog on.\nWhat I discovered in a lot of reviews was how narrow the tracks are, how hard it is to put together, and how tall you could be.\nI decided on this treadmill because out of the rest of them, it had average scores. I realize Iâm paying an average price so I can put up with the annoying parts.\nPros- cheap but works- even though the track is narrow it isnât something you canât get used too. Iâm 5â11 and 195 pounds and Iâm able to run comfortably on this.\nCons- it came with the right handle foam messed up. Itâs somethint little, bit I feel like for the price I paid, nothing should be messed up.\nIt was hard and weird to put together. The instructions are vague and the washers they want you to use to screw in the screws are super weird so it takes a lot longer then it should. Over all though Iâm yaooy with my purchase"

At first, I heard sound and saw light from the machine, but soon after the machine would not power on all together. I tested the outlets to see if it was that, but the outlets were working. The treadmill still did not power on. Even worse, after I returned it, I had to fight tooth and nail to get a refund. These people are scammers. Amazon had to step in because after following Best Choiceâ return policy, Best Choice still refused to issue the refund.

(And let's face it, the pictures aren't great either)\nI scoured the internet looking for a treadmill that had great reviews but also had features I needed. Ultimately the size and price on this one were hard to beat. Considering the size of my home and also being on lockdown during the quarantine, I decided to take a chance and buy it.\nMy treadmill arrived with no issues. It was easy to set up. I love that my phone hooks right up via Bluetooth. The only thing I don't like is not being able to use it if you lose the remote. There may be a way to do this but I haven't really looked into it because I have just been enjoying using it.\nI can see why size may be an issue for some. But in comparison to all the other treadmills on Amazon that are made with space saving in mind....I think this one is the biggest. I am female...5'9\" and 145 pounds. I can lift it up, wheel it in my closet and lean it against the wall when I'm done...which is awesome. ð\nThis works great for me and I have no regrets so far. Hopefully it continues to work for the long run! I didn't buy the warranty because I wasn't sure if I was going to like it and I didn't want to waste my money if I had to return it. Now I'm kind of wishing I had just in case.\nIf anything changes I will update but so far so good!"

     "name": "Itâs Easy to set up. The remote control is so useful. Much better than reaching for a control panel. The Bluetooth speaker is convenient; it turns your treadmill into a moving dance floor! Just plug in, turn on, the audio pairs instantly. Itâs a well-made, sleek machine. It Fits so nicely in the room, people never realize I have one. I hardly notice that I am exercising when I use it, because itâs so fun and convenient! Track is comfortable; I did have to get in the habit of walking right at the front of the belt. It is helpful to use a scrap piece of carpet underneath it and cover it, to avoid dust and pet hair getting inside. Most importantly, this Company has exceptional customer service. The best I have ever encountered. You can rest assured when ordering Cool products from them. This is the second treadmill I have bought from them."

     "name": "I love this treadmill. I gained a few pounds during quarantine and I wanted to do something about it. To start: Iâm not a runner!!! This treadmill has a speed setting (up to a 10 pace) which allowed me to do some jogging. As time passed, I went from a ONE MINUTE jog at a 6.5 pace, to a full mile at a 10 pace! This is HUGE for someone like me. (Overweight and dislikes running ð) I actually accomplished running goals that I didnât know I had. Granted, there is no incline so itâs a lot easier than running through my hilly neighborhood. Iâve lost some weight and âbeatâ a few of my running records! This machine actually built my courage to try a little bit of outdoor running. The Bluetooth setting is a bonus. Itâs doesnât have a top notch sound but it works well."

    {
     "name": "This is the absolutely perfect treadmill for me and my family. It is small and light enough to move around the house and most especially to hide. Yet, it is powerful enough to run on, even to the point of almost sprinting. It might not be a perfect length for a tall man, but for us it's incredible. I set up a light, cheap tv on a tripod type stand placed in front and hook it up to my phone and watch my shows as I speed walk. I look forward to exercise now! When I'm done I can just lean it against the wall out of the way. It takes up no space.\nThe only downside is that you can only control it through a remote control, which can easily get lost. It happened to me despite worrying about it so much that I taped it to the bar. Well, the tape wasn't strong enough and somehow it vanished. I blame the dogs. I was so upset, considering how much I had warned my kids about this very thing happening. I was scared that the seller wouldn't respond, but they did and sent me a new remote promptly. I am incredibly, incredibly grateful, because we LOVE this treadmill! Excellent customer service!"

     "name": "I'm a writer, and since the pandemic started, I just haven't been getting enough exercise. I'd always been intrigued by the idea of a walking desk, though, so I looked for a basic, affordable way to make that dream a reality. This fit the bill perfectly.\nThis isn't the type of treadmill you'd find in any gym--it's much smaller, lighter, and more basic than that. It doesn't have an incline function, for example, and the belt is both shorter and narrower than standard. Although it does go faster than most walking-desk treadmills, I haven't yet tried to run on it.\nI've been using it for at least an hour a day -- my aim is to get up to two hours a day. I find I can walk 3 mph while reading or typing. Things like editing (which require more manual dexterity with a cursor) are much harder while walking, so I save those tasks for the times when I'm sitting.\nOverall, this is a great little treadmill. It is perfect for what I needed it for. Highly recommend."

     "name": "This might be the very best thing I've invested in. Since Covid has forced me to work from home and spend many hours at a desk, I decided it was time to get up. I started researching treadmill desks and saw how expensive they were, so I opted for a cheaper resolution. This folding treadmill pairs well with a standing table I purchased for around $60, and together, is less than half the price of a standing table treadmill. It's not as lightweight as I would like, and I wish it did recline, but I realize I can't necessarily have every feature I desire plus convenience of price and space saving. I've walked up to 5 miles while reading and grading papers. I've only had it for a couple weeks... so I can't report too much on overall physical changes as far as weight loss at this point, but I can say that I feel SO MUCH BETTER. I'm SO MUCH more alert and awake than when I was working from a chair. Also, I use it when I'm catching up on a Netflix series. I use this as a supplement to my original workout plan. It's not a replacment, but it is an added bonus to adopting a healthier lifestyle. I use it mostly for work purposes. If you want to feel more alert while working on things that might normally put you to sleep, OR if you just want to improve your posture, your overall mood, and health in general, it's fully worth it. Honestly, I think society in general should start considering why the norm is \"sitting\" when it comes to desk jobs."

     "name": "I knew this was a cheap treadmill but I didn't expect it to be so poorly made/tested. When it arrived, it would not turn on at all (it showed an \"E07\" error message on the display that was not documented in the very terse instructions). I emailed the support email that was given in the instructions and was given steps for taking apart the handle to try and fix this on my own. It ended up being the safety switch sensor was not attached inside the handle which I fixed sufficiently so that it would turn on. At that point, the treadmill would turn on but it would only go up to the 4.0 speed (units is not clear, km/h?) with the handle up. I discovered with the handle down, it would allow the speed to increase up to 12.0 ð± (definitely not safe to do without the handle and safety switch). I emailed support again and was given more step by step instructions for disassembling and investigating the wiring to find the problem. It turned out to be the tilt sensor for detecting when the handle was up was not attached and was also relatively easy to fix.\nSo, at this point, the treadmill works and is functional enough that we'll keep it. I feel like the price was low enough that I'm not going to return it just to pay more for another but I definitely wouldn't recommend purchasing the product given all the defects it had when it arrived and the expectation by support that you take the thing apart and fix things yourself. I don't expect that it will last very long but maybe (given the low price) we'll have gotten our money's worth."

     "name": "Just got this in the mail yesterday, set up was really easy! I tested it out and itâs a little choppy going slower but for the price and the compactness of the treadmill and the price it is a great buy. Iâm terrible with running outside in the winter but we live in a two bedroom condo so this was a great way to keep up running in the cold season while not taking up too much space in our home. I will say I wish the power chord was longer, itâs very short so Iâm going to have to get an extension chord so we can put it a bit off to the side. Only other small complaint is the cell phone holder is too small for my iPhone 11 Pro Max with an OtterBox case on it. Also, it is a little heavy but the wheels are helpful when moving around. All in all though would definitely recommend!"

I wasnât sure if I would ever use it for more than walking. But I was to surprised to discover my love of running with this little treadmill! This machine may have quite literally saved me from pandemic depression."

When I had taken about a week going through many adverts telling us they are the best, then I saw this Dripex at full price and showing it was a best seller and was expecting to get another product less expensive, but decided \"You only get what you pay for\" as this looked so stylish and compact, when I order it Two days ago I was expecting it within a week but arrived this morning less than 48 hours and the packaging(protection) it came in perhaps the best I have ever seen in my 77 years and the credit at least must go to the suppler/importer for the care taken to ensure there was no damage to their product.\nI found it easy to put 4 bolts and two screws in with the excellent tools supplied with it.\nMy wife and myself have already tried it out and think it is fabulous and very quite in operation and so neat and tidy with no sharp edges and a great safety device in case we stutter on our feet(hope not).\nThe displays are very clear and tidy with a simple remote control that the young ones would love (see no hands), but we must hold onto the well balance arms I'm sure.\nBy and large this product is well worth the Â£399.99 and should suit any age group.\nLastly if it improves our walking for health reasons it will have done it's job well."

     "name": "I have given this a two star and thats only for the customer service, thanks to joyce. The product when arrived didnt work well - running belt stuck/ stuttered badly, followed the instructions to fix and it made no difference, contacted joyce about the fault and she sent more videos to help but that didnt work either- i asked for a replacement and it arrived a few days later which was good but when it did arrive the outer casing was smashed, the phone holder is smashed and the casing was lose - good news though the actual treadmill worked. I contacted joyce about this and they offerred a 100 discount or a new treadmill.\nAs it was cosmetic damage i took the discount and i didnt want a 3rd treadmill as they dont want the faulty ones back !!! I have to say the workmanship was absolute rubbish and i think most of the reviews must be fake if mine is an example of the quality of the product - i cannot see how i can get two faulty ones in a row and everybody else seems to have no issues. Anyway - like i said at the start joyce is the only reason for the stars."

     "name": "Research getting a treadmill for weeks before deciding, best decision I've made in 2020.\nQuite heavy for one person but still manageable, and means that it's sturdy when running. Struggled to put the handles on as the bolts could do with being a bit longer but I've ended up leaving them off, which doesn't affect the functionality of the treadmill. Great display at the bottom which I keep focused on and it stops me from losing my stepping (I'm prone to falling over). Haven't tried the speaker yet but I'm fine using my phone or earphones. Machine runs really quietly, compared to a treadmill I had in the past which was a lot bigger and bulkier. Remote control is very handy and a good idea but the finger pad is also very sensitive and works really well.\nWould recommend this to anyone, especially if you have limited space or want it to have a prominent place in the house (not the garage) to keep your motivation up to use it, rather than out if sight out of mind. It looks good and can be easily moved around the house. My jogging speed is about 6km and the machine was really comfortable at that, haven't taken it to full speed yet. I had concerns before buying it that the belt would be quite small, but this hasn't been an issue and I would say that there was quite a lot of room for me to jog at a decent stride (I'm 5'7\" tall).\nNeed to also comment on the delivery company: kept me informed, arrive 6 days ahead of schedule, arrived in the time frame they texted me and the driver lifted it into the house for me as well. Couldn't fault them.\nReally impressed, exactly what I need to sort myself out, in lockdown, in bad weather etc."

     "name": "I go out walking most days but as we are moving into winter, I bought this treadmill to use when I canât get out - canât go to the gym because of coronavirus. It arrived as stated, but the box had a massive break which when I opened the package had damaged the treadmill in a couple of places. I contacted the seller who were brilliant, they reacted quickly, gave me a discount and had replacement parts sent to me - which is great considering it clearly wasnât their problem and had been damaged in transit.\nIn terms of the treadmill, it is a bit flimsy but operates perfectly well and considering the price, I think it is good value and would still rate it highly."

    },
    {
     "name": "Very quick delivery, they even tried to deliver it a few days early which I sadly missed, but shows great response speed. Instruction manual very helpful and easy to understand, just as simple to setup only real difficulty came in the form of allen key which didn't quite fit in one of the bolts to secure the balance arms on the side. Once fastened no issues.\nWith the phone holder and bluetooth connection, easy to watch something or listen to music through it if you wish while working out, most treadmills only go up to 6, with this one going up to 12 it lets you get into a nice run to work with, so its wonderful for home fitness if your not someone who actively goes out much, Remote has a slight delay so do be careful if using it to speed up/slow down, tapping it lightly does control speed easier/safer so do be warned if you hold button down you might accidently go too fast too quickly if not ready for it.\nI'm very happy with this so if you are looking for a home treadmill that has a little more speed to it than most, minimal setup and not taking up that much space, go for it! Thank you to the providers/makers this is gonna do me wonders! This is practically gym level so the only thing I'll warn against it is don't go for this if your looking for a walking treadmill for the elderly."
    },
    {
     "name": "Great machine, very easy to use. My only real criticisms are a few design features that could easily be improved. The arms currently need to be removed before you can fold it flat, for example. Having them attached to the side of the frame and collapsible might change the look, but would mean I didn't need to dig out the screws every time I want to use it. Also, the wheels on the base only face forward, which makes it tricky to slide horizontal (ie to store under the sofa). That said, its a great treadmill if you have limited space. Very sturdy and good quality."
    },
    {
     "name": "Easy to install, although the hand rails are very very tricky to attach. Gave up after getting one done. Itâs a really nice machine. My only problem is that the speed seems to be wrong. 4k for example feels more like 6k on other treadmills. But doesnât matter too much."

     "name": "Great treadmill. Mine arrived damaged but the customer service team were great and sent out a replacement for the damaged piece quickly.

I'm a fairly athletic women and I have no issues folding this up or moving it around (A friend and I also managed to carry the box up 2 flights of steep stairs). I had it up and running within about 30 minutes of opening the box. I love how compact it is. I live in an apartment and I have this in my living area between my couch and tv. When not in use I can fold it up to the side of the tv and still have the full space for doing other workouts. I use it on a carpet rug which seems to keep the noise and any extra movement down. Its not as easy on the knees as a professional treadmill, but I was surprised at how comfortable it is to run on. It has a button to slow the speed down to 2.5mph when you are done running. The one small complaint I have its that it doesn't have a speed up button so it takes a while to get over 6mph by holding the up button down."

I love that it was ready to operate right out of the box with nothing more than the plastic device holder to add on. I am very happy with its performance and would highly recommend this treadmill for anyone looking for a sturdy machine, no assembly required, with limited space. I was worried about it handling my size and weight (6â2â- 235 lbs) but I run comfortably and it doesnât sound or feel like Iâm stressing the treadmill at all."

When I am on it I increase and decrease the speed constantly for my workouts and it keeps up perfectly. It was held by the post office past the day it said itâd be delivered, I emailed the sender and they got back to me quickly stating they contacted the courier and my treadmill was delivered the next day. Very responsive. Wish there was more in stock so I can get another for my mom."

     "name": "Iâve had this treadmill for about 1.5 months now and use it at least an hour every other day for brisk walking and light jogging. Itâs super quiet and I fold it upright and roll it into another room when Iâm done with it, which... itâs pretty heavy (Iâm a female with some muscle but not super strong or anything). Itâs narrow enough to fit through a standard bedroom door. Only two things I didnât like: there is no pause button so if you stop your workout to get water (no cup holders on this thing, which I donât mind but others might), everything resets when you âresumeâ your workout. The other thing are the arm handles. Because the treadmill isnât that wide, when I have the arm handles up I was whacking my arms into them while I was walking. The arms do fold down easily so I keep them down. Iâm 5â5â. The belt is long enough for me, even with my long stride.\nOverall Iâm happy so far. It was fricken heavy to drag into the house by myself. It was left leaning up against my house next to the garage. Iâd highly recommend two people to get it into the house and to assemble it, though it is possible to do it yourself."

     "name": "This treadmill was affordable and completely worth the investment. I bought it because there are very few accessible walking/running paths around me, and because winter is coming up and I know my steps decrease with the cold weather. I like this treadmill even more than I anticipated. Iâm a very small person (4â11â) and I was able to set this up in minutes to use after it was delivered. Iâm able to move it around and fold it up to store with ease. I only gave it a 4 for sturdiness because if youâre running on it and havenât tightened the mechanisms tight enough after unfolding it seems a little less unstableâbut this shouldnât be a problem after tightening it! I like the size of it because it can fit in a tight corner and not take up too much space. I would recommend this for anyone who has a tight space and wants to have a treadmill that doesnât look too bulky. The option to turn the handles down is great if you donât want to feel too constricted while jogging. I put the handles down and set up extensions from a dog gate to sit on the handles to set a laptop on for getting steps in while working from home. Overall it gets 5 stars from me!"

     "name": "Updated Feb 2, 2021\nWould raise my rating to 5.5 stars if it were possible.\nTreadmill motor handled my 12 mile run @6.7MPH with ease and no skipping. And, I uncovered a very useful undocumented feature.\nIn the workout I learned the treadmill can run INDEFINITELY! When the time display reaches 99:59 (MM:SS), rather than turn off like most treadmills do, the OVICX Q2S simply rolls the clock over and keeps going.\nI ran on the treadmill nonstop for 108 minutes with no issues at all. There was no need to restart the treadmill to get in a workout lasting more than 100 minutes!\nThe display adjusts the decimal place and rolls over when needed to keep âcountingâ. My 12 mile run was:\nTime â 00:00 to 99:59 then roll over to 00:00 and finish at 08:00\nCalories â 0.00 to 9.99, then 10.0 to 99.9, then 100 to 999, then rollover back to 0.00 and finish at 110\nDistance (miles) â 0.00 to 9.99, then 10.0 to 12.0\nOrdered Jan 3, 2021 and received four days later (not Prime). Unboxed three days later.\nMy requirements: treadmill motor capable of 8MPH+, no bulky console, no fancy programming. I just want to get my miles as a long time runner, marathoner, and pace leader. The OVICX Q2S exceeded my expectations.\nDisplay is MPH. Pleasantly surprised! I was expecting KPH due to the foreign manufacturer origin.\nSpeed display is 100% accurate. I tested 2MPH, 3MPH, 5MPH, 7MPH, and 8.7MPH. Without any load, the tread speed matched the display. I tested by measuring the tread distance traveled (113.5 inches) per rotation and timed the revolutions.\nThe motor is excellent based on my workouts. This was my most important requirement. I ran all kinds workouts and the motor was perfect each time. No jerkiness or skipping to throw off my cadence. Example of runs I did to test the motor (I also rechecked the treadmill speed accuracy after a workout):\nRun/walk 7 miles - 6.0MPH, short walk, 6.1MPH, short walk, etc. (using the shift feature)\nRun 8 miles, negative split, 6.3MPH to 7.0MPH (overall avg 6.8MPH)\nRun 5 miles, negative split, 2.5MPH warmup, 6.5MPH to 7.3MPH (overall avg 7.0MPH)\nWalk 4 miles at 4MPH\nMore than 40 miles in about 18 days of use and no issues whatsoever.\nThe motor was more quiet than I expected. I had no issues hearing the music from my iPad. For me, no need to use earbuds.\nThe intelligent speed reduction is perfect for run/walk training or interval training. Touch the shift button and the treadmill gradually slows down to 2.5MPH. Touch the shift button again and the treadmill automatically goes back to whatever speed you had before the first shift. While in speed reduction mode, you can manually adjust your speed up or down from 2.5MPH.\nThere is no incline feature. I didnât want to add weight and bulk to the treadmill. I have enough hills in my neighborhood.\nThe safety sidebars can be raised or lowered independently of each other. This gives flexibility for room placement. You could have one bar up and the other one down. I simply have both bars down since I donât rely on them (see photo). My wife likes the right sidebar up when she uses the treadmill. Adding to the quality, the sidebars are solid metal, not plastic.\nTread length and width is just right. My stride does not weave side to side, so the 17 inch width is more than adequate. The tread length is also more than sufficient for my stride length.\nThe device holder could be a tad better. The blue plastic ledge comes with a tacky pad (think TENS massage pad tacky) to adhere your device. The pad is so tacky that pulling the device off is a challenge. My workaround: I exposed only a small portion of the pad, just enough keep my iPad attached. Then, I use two rubber bands as tie downs (see photo).\nNo speakers, but Bluetooth enables the FitShow app to control the treadmill and save workout history. It was easy to register and connect the app. I did not try much of the app features because I didnât purchase the treadmill for the app.\nI like the slim and compact design. If I wanted, I could fold up the treadmill and slide it into my Prius to take it somewhere. This treadmill is not boxy or bulky.\nThe heart rate monitor feature isn't the easiest to use. You must touch three of the four touchpads (two fingers from one hand, one finger from the other hand) to get a reading.\nThe console is simple, with just a few buttons. No complicated display to figure out. The console is very steady at any speed, no wobbling or shaking. This treadmill is very sturdy.\nWhat convinced me to take a chance and order this treadmill? A YouTube video showing one of the employees running on the treadmill at the max speed 14KPH (8.7MPH) the entire video and the treadmill never shook or wobbled."

     "name": "I like the compactness of the item and its features. It is so easy to set up. That said I cannot adjust the belt which is almost hitting on one side and there is a constant squeak when I am walking on the machine. Not if I just turn it on and let it run but when I stand on it. Its very annoying and I am now regretting the purchase UPDATE DO NOT BUY this machine true it is compact but you get what you pay for...the constant squeak in the machine is driving me NUTS it starts to squeak the minute I step on it. I added the silicone bought a mat have tried different positions It was a mistake and I will have to put up with the squeak until it breaks down which will probably be soon so I can buy a decent treadmill"

     "name": "I have researched treadmills for several weeks and tried to make sure I got the best deal. I found this treadmill and had trouble finding anything seriously negative listed in the reviews, so made the decision to purchase it.\nFirst, I ordered on January 21st. I was told it would arrive between February 2-8. It arrived on January 25th. Impressive. The box was in pretty bad shape and I was concerned the machine would be damaged. It is packed fairly well with lots of styrofoam and the foam did it's job. There was no damage to the machine.\nSecond, we set it up straight from the box and were able to use it within 2 minutes of opening it. The only assembly is putting the blue shelf on top of the handle bars and attaching the safety strap. There are a variety of body sizes in our family, ranging from 200 lbs to 250 lbs. We all tested out the machine and it performed quite well with us all. It is as quite as any treadmill that I have ever used. I spend about 30 minutes walking on it and my husband says it is not disturbing while sitting within 8' of me.\nWe feel the unit is very stable and sturdy. The attached video is made with a 6'2 man weighing 200 lbs using it. None of us run, so I cannot attest to its performance under those circumstances.\nIt is too heavy (around 95 lbs) to move upstairs or over surfaces that are not level unless you have two people, but it does roll fairly easy. It is easy to fold up and lean up along a wall. It requires almost 10\" to stand up along the wall I would assume it would roll under a bed if you have at least 15\" clearance. The position of the wheels means it does not roll when the unit is almost horizontal.\nI would HIGHLY recommend this product."

     "name": "There is absolutely NO SHOCK ABSORPTION at all. Feels like I was running on hard pavement- not good at all. I don't recommend. Also, the controls are in light font on the device you can't even read what they say and the machine when I tested it yesterday while it was still working, kept stopping on me in the middle of my workout. It might be because I accidnetally hit the slow button I have no idea but apparently I did it three times so there is an issue. I would NOT buy this treadmil, especially for the money. There are better ones out there with shock absorption and other options for controls, etc. Stay clear of this one."

     "name": "My wife and I are octogenarians. We used to use a treadmill in a nearby gym, but the pandemic ruled that out. So we did lots of walking together outdoors, but the cold weather stopped that, too. We needed a treadmill that would fit into the very small space we found in my wife's \"matting room\" (she's an artist). The photos show the treadmill tucked into the corner of this very small room, and my wife beginning her exercise routine.\nThis machine arrived on November 1st (almost 3 months ago.) It was too heavy for us to bring into the house by ourselves, so we got someone to help us. Once it was in the right space, however, it was simplicity itself to set up. The user's manual was easy to follow.\nLet me tell you: This machine is rock solid. It doesn't wiggle or waver when we're on it; we feel very secure. And it has plenty of power to develop speed without any sign of strain. It does what it claims -- easily, with power to spare.\nThis treadmill is designed to run on the flat -- with no incline. That suits us just fine, and we get a good workout with it. The shock absorbers work well; there's no jolting on our knees. One feature we especially like is the button which, when pressed, slows the treadmill down to 2.5 miles an hour. Press it again, and it accelerates to your original speed.\nAfter her first workout, my wife of 59.5 years turned to me and said, Oh Paul, you got just the right machine -- you're so smart! Needless to say, that made my day."

I love that it was ready to operate right out of the box with nothing more than the plastic device holder to add on. I am very happy with its performance and would highly recommend this treadmill for anyone looking for a sturdy machine, no assembly required, with limited space. I was worried about it handling my size and weight (6â2â- 235 lbs) but I run comfortably and it doesnât sound or feel like Iâm stressing the treadmill at all."

     "name": "Really easy to use. The only downside is that it was heavy trying to get it out of the box. It runs smoothly, it doesnât sound like youâre clonking around when youâre running on it, itâs absolutely perfect. When I am on it I increase and decrease the speed constantly for my workouts and it keeps up perfectly. It was held by the post office past the day it said itâd be delivered, I emailed the sender and they got back to me quickly stating they contacted the courier and my treadmill was delivered the next day. Very responsive. Wish there was more in stock so I can get another for my mom."

     "name": "Iâve had this treadmill for about 1.5 months now and use it at least an hour every other day for brisk walking and light jogging. Itâs super quiet and I fold it upright and roll it into another room when Iâm done with it, which... itâs pretty heavy (Iâm a female with some muscle but not super strong or anything). Itâs narrow enough to fit through a standard bedroom door. Only two things I didnât like: there is no pause button so if you stop your workout to get water (no cup holders on this thing, which I donât mind but others might), everything resets when you âresumeâ your workout. The other thing are the arm handles. Because the treadmill isnât that wide, when I have the arm handles up I was whacking my arms into them while I was walking. The arms do fold down easily so I keep them down. Iâm 5â5â. The belt is long enough for me, even with my long stride.\nOverall Iâm happy so far. It was fricken heavy to drag into the house by myself. It was left leaning up against my house next to the garage. Iâd highly recommend two people to get it into the house and to assemble it, though it is possible to do it yourself."

     "name": "This treadmill was affordable and completely worth the investment. I bought it because there are very few accessible walking/running paths around me, and because winter is coming up and I know my steps decrease with the cold weather. I like this treadmill even more than I anticipated. Iâm a very small person (4â11â) and I was able to set this up in minutes to use after it was delivered. Iâm able to move it around and fold it up to store with ease. I only gave it a 4 for sturdiness because if youâre running on it and havenât tightened the mechanisms tight enough after unfolding it seems a little less unstableâbut this shouldnât be a problem after tightening it! I like the size of it because it can fit in a tight corner and not take up too much space. I would recommend this for anyone who has a tight space and wants to have a treadmill that doesnât look too bulky. The option to turn the handles down is great if you donât want to feel too constricted while jogging. I put the handles down and set up extensions from a dog gate to sit on the handles to set a laptop on for getting steps in while working from home. Overall it gets 5 stars from me!"

     "name": "Updated Feb 2, 2021\nWould raise my rating to 5.5 stars if it were possible.\nTreadmill motor handled my 12 mile run @6.7MPH with ease and no skipping. And, I uncovered a very useful undocumented feature.\nIn the workout I learned the treadmill can run INDEFINITELY! When the time display reaches 99:59 (MM:SS), rather than turn off like most treadmills do, the OVICX Q2S simply rolls the clock over and keeps going.\nI ran on the treadmill nonstop for 108 minutes with no issues at all. There was no need to restart the treadmill to get in a workout lasting more than 100 minutes!\nThe display adjusts the decimal place and rolls over when needed to keep âcountingâ. My 12 mile run was:\nTime â 00:00 to 99:59 then roll over to 00:00 and finish at 08:00\nCalories â 0.00 to 9.99, then 10.0 to 99.9, then 100 to 999, then rollover back to 0.00 and finish at 110\nDistance (miles) â 0.00 to 9.99, then 10.0 to 12.0\nOrdered Jan 3, 2021 and received four days later (not Prime). Unboxed three days later.\nMy requirements: treadmill motor capable of 8MPH+, no bulky console, no fancy programming. I just want to get my miles as a long time runner, marathoner, and pace leader. The OVICX Q2S exceeded my expectations.\nDisplay is MPH. Pleasantly surprised! I was expecting KPH due to the foreign manufacturer origin.\nSpeed display is 100% accurate. I tested 2MPH, 3MPH, 5MPH, 7MPH, and 8.7MPH. Without any load, the tread speed matched the display. I tested by measuring the tread distance traveled (113.5 inches) per rotation and timed the revolutions.\nThe motor is excellent based on my workouts. This was my most important requirement. I ran all kinds workouts and the motor was perfect each time. No jerkiness or skipping to throw off my cadence. Example of runs I did to test the motor (I also rechecked the treadmill speed accuracy after a workout):\nRun/walk 7 miles - 6.0MPH, short walk, 6.1MPH, short walk, etc. (using the shift feature)\nRun 8 miles, negative split, 6.3MPH to 7.0MPH (overall avg 6.8MPH)\nRun 5 miles, negative split, 2.5MPH warmup, 6.5MPH to 7.3MPH (overall avg 7.0MPH)\nWalk 4 miles at 4MPH\nMore than 40 miles in about 18 days of use and no issues whatsoever.\nThe motor was more quiet than I expected. I had no issues hearing the music from my iPad. For me, no need to use earbuds.\nThe intelligent speed reduction is perfect for run/walk training or interval training. Touch the shift button and the treadmill gradually slows down to 2.5MPH. Touch the shift button again and the treadmill automatically goes back to whatever speed you had before the first shift. While in speed reduction mode, you can manually adjust your speed up or down from 2.5MPH.\nThere is no incline feature. I didnât want to add weight and bulk to the treadmill. I have enough hills in my neighborhood.\nThe safety sidebars can be raised or lowered independently of each other. This gives flexibility for room placement. You could have one bar up and the other one down. I simply have both bars down since I donât rely on them (see photo). My wife likes the right sidebar up when she uses the treadmill. Adding to the quality, the sidebars are solid metal, not plastic.\nTread length and width is just right. My stride does not weave side to side, so the 17 inch width is more than adequate. The tread length is also more than sufficient for my stride length.\nThe device holder could be a tad better. The blue plastic ledge comes with a tacky pad (think TENS massage pad tacky) to adhere your device. The pad is so tacky that pulling the device off is a challenge. My workaround: I exposed only a small portion of the pad, just enough keep my iPad attached. Then, I use two rubber bands as tie downs (see photo).\nNo speakers, but Bluetooth enables the FitShow app to control the treadmill and save workout history. It was easy to register and connect the app. I did not try much of the app features because I didnât purchase the treadmill for the app.\nI like the slim and compact design. If I wanted, I could fold up the treadmill and slide it into my Prius to take it somewhere. This treadmill is not boxy or bulky.\nThe heart rate monitor feature isn't the easiest to use. You must touch three of the four touchpads (two fingers from one hand, one finger from the other hand) to get a reading.\nThe console is simple, with just a few buttons. No complicated display to figure out. The console is very steady at any speed, no wobbling or shaking. This treadmill is very sturdy.\nWhat convinced me to take a chance and order this treadmill? A YouTube video showing one of the employees running on the treadmill at the max speed 14KPH (8.7MPH) the entire video and the treadmill never shook or wobbled."

     "name": "I like the compactness of the item and its features. It is so easy to set up. That said I cannot adjust the belt which is almost hitting on one side and there is a constant squeak when I am walking on the machine. Not if I just turn it on and let it run but when I stand on it. Its very annoying and I am now regretting the purchase UPDATE DO NOT BUY this machine true it is compact but you get what you pay for...the constant squeak in the machine is driving me NUTS it starts to squeak the minute I step on it. I added the silicone bought a mat have tried different positions It was a mistake and I will have to put up with the squeak until it breaks down which will probably be soon so I can buy a decent treadmill"

It is a little rickety which I do not like and there is no incline despite that being in the product description. No inline sucks. It should be standard on any treadmill. Especially for the 600 dollar tag. I made a mistake getting a no name brand product. Speed is kind of low as well with a top speed of 9mph. I have had better for cheaper. I haven't used it yet but it will be helpful during this pandemic so I can somewhat maintain a level of fitness. Feeling a bit disappointed because the quality is on the lower end."

     "name": "For the price tag, Iâm pleasantly surprised at the quality of this treadmill. This will be just what I need to help reach 10,000+ steps during these upcoming winter months. Setup was really easy, but youâll need 2 people to move it to where itâs going to stay. I was a little nervous with some of the reviews saying you canât really run on this treadmill, but thatâs not the case for me. I will use this for walking/running. The speed goes up to 9, and is way faster then I ever plan to use lol!\nI will say (as you can see from the video) it does shake a bit, but itâs not enough to bother me. Here are some things Iâm not crazy about:\n- My devices donât really stay put on the holder, itâs almost not a deep enough shelf. My phone slides right off of it. Thankfully I can wrap my Ipad cover around it to stay in place gwhile I watch and walk!\n- Thereâs no where to hold your water bottle\n- I donât think it accurately tracks distance. It always says Iâm way ahead of my apple watch (ie Iâll hit 1 mile on the treadmill but my watch says .75miles)\nThe bluetooth feature is pretty cool and easily hooks up to my phone/Ipad for music or tv sound.\nOverall, this is perfect for what I bought it for and am excited to use it all winter."

Instructions could definitely be improved but after some reading and thinking, we got it done. The pictures of two of the screws don't show any nuts but there are nuts on them so we just took them off. Then in the list of screws there were some that weren't listed but that were included in the instructions... Then when it said to turn it on it took a bit to find the on button. It is at the very front bottom. Now that we got it together it works well so far. We chose this one because of reviews of lighter ones saying that they rocked when people ran on them and this is a tiny bit wider than most. This is very stable. You can fold it up but you have to unscrew 4 screws to do so and it will still take up a lot of space. Not the best for portability and small spaces and for a person by themselves but if you have a helper and enough space it is good and stable."

Built great but not to really put in good work for heavy long runs. Motor will overheat. My routine is 90 minutes. I'll do 1hr running 30 minutes of walking and jogging. 5/6 days a week.

The +/- button is located centimeters past where your hand sits for the heartbeat pulse. It sped up so quickly there was nothing she could do.

     "name": "So happy with this purchase. I researched for weeks trying to make a decision and finally decided on this treadmill.Such good quality running machine, very easy to assemble, packaged very neatly and protectively. Lightweight but durable, silent powerful 2.5HP motor provide good stability and durability. Iâm 5â9 and the treadmill easily accommodates a long stride, it is more than long enough to walk or run. Itâs 3- Independent LCD Monitor is my favorite, easy to track the real-time training data. Well, the dual position mobile phone holder is great, I can enjoy the perfect training and entertainment in 2 different viewing angles, making it easier to keep exercising. I love the incline feature, very quiet and easy to store. It takes little space when fold it up for storage at room. It was a very good investment for not only myself but my family. I am a very satisfied customer and recommend."

     "name": "My previous treadmill was far more expensive and robust, so by comparison this one is almost adorable itâs so petite. Lol. That said, I just wanted it for walking on particularly cold or busy days when I couldnât get to the woods, so I love its small footprint.\nPositives:\nâ¢Super easy to assemble solo. I got it in front the porch and assembled it independently, so that was nice.\nâ¢Iâm a larger woman and was concerned about the weight limit that Iâm near, but the unit doesnât seem stressed by my walking on it. Itâs obviously not as solid as my last one, but thatâs okay.\nâ¢Affordable.\nâ¢Doesnât have a bunch of unnecessary dashboard tools that hardly anyone would use anyhow.\nâ¢Love adjusting the speed on the handrail.\nNegatives:\nâ¢I absolutely HATE that itâs so narrow that I must keep my hands bent and up or they constantly hit the handrails. I wish the handrails were more like little nubs there for if one became unbalanced but out of the way otherwise.\nâ¢The speed isnât accurate. At all. Itâs indicating 5mph when I am absolutely notâplease trust meâwalking at that speed.\nâ¢The buttons on the dashboard are the kind of slightly puffy but thicker plastic you just know are going to crack after a couple years. You know the kind.\nOverall Iâm pleased with this affordable, small treadmill."

     "name": "As I've mentioned from my initial entry, this is a progressive review. I changed it to 5 stars and here is why: Advenor customer service was great, at least from my experience. They have been keeping in touch for the update of the replacement part via email and phone. From this, I could tell that they want to better their products. The treadmill performance have been amazing, my wife and I really enjoyed using it for a week now. If not for the broken motor casing when it was delivered, I would have given this product a 5 star review at the beginning for the price and performance (i.e. quiet motor, smooth running).\nInitial review:\nLike the other reviews, this one arrived broken. I will give a one star for the product for now and 3 stars for the customer service since the wait was not that bad. The customer rep said that they will keep in touch via email. This is a progressive review, I will update the comment once they fix the issue."

The release bar to unfold is really nice, Treadmill gently unfolds down to use. The point is that I want to voice out my experience as follows:\n1. ADVENOR customer service is excellent .\n2. The unit is light and has roller wheels.\n3. Space saving size.\n4. Running length/width is excellent.\n5. Motor is Powerful and stable.\n6. Rich exercise program.\nIt's easy enough for my kids to use also. Overall a great item.\nReally worth recommending to my friends who are thinking of exercising at home ."

This NEW treadmill was the right price, the right size, the right everything to fit my needs! I recently purchased this and I LOVE IT!! I am impressed with all it can do to be so powerful. Dual holders on the console are so good for me to put iPad or mobile phone on 2 different positions. BTW, ADVENORâs slogan \"Running Is An Attitude\" moved me very much. Exactly, I am sure I have more courage and confidence to be awakened and actively face the challenges in life. I definitely recommend this treadmill and will be getting one for my young brother!"

     "name": "Over the past few months I have been slowly amassing an assortment of exercise equipment preparing for the inevitable closure of gyms (again). An avid gym goer I frequented the gym 4-5 times a week pre Corona. I have quite a bit of equipment and machines at home now. Because I already own some expensive pieces such as a Stairmaster, stationary bike, and barbell weights, I did not want to invest too much money on a treadmill. I was looking for a very simple yet effective model. I was hesitant about purchasing such an item online, but I figured Amazon is great with returns so I should be okay. Also I purchased the 2 year service plan by Asurion. I completed lengthy research because there are so many options. I wanted a folding model to conserve space. Other options either had ridiculous mandatory features such as ifit or horrible customer service reviews (even big name companies). For my usage purposes, I see absolutely no reason to need anything like ifit. I construct my own training sessions and don't follow programs and all I really need for a work out are my Beats, heart rate monitor, and old school training journal. I was familiar with this company because I ordered their weight bench recently. I love the bench so I figured I'd try the treadmill. The treadmill was extremely easy to set up. It is very sturdy and constructed well. I like that when you release it from the folded up position to the walking position it is a slow release... much less danger of accidently crushing a pet or your feet! I haven't really played around with the programs but the console is exactly what I wanted: a way to simply track calories and distance. I like that it has controls on the arm rests too. It runs pretty quietly. I am a petite person (5'4'' and petite build) and the machine is a perfect size. I don't know if the size would be adequate for a larger individual as there is a weight limit of 220 lbs and also the width is not the same as a standard teadmill. I don't intend to run on the machine as I prefer steady state cardio- walking at a moderate to fast pace. Because of this I cannot attest to how well the machine will hold up for running. The only suggestions I have so far is to find a way to turn off the beeping noise when you press start or stop and to enclose the back of the control panel so the wires are completely covered. But those are minor cosmetic suggestions. The most important thing is how the machine runs and so far great! I will update this review as necessary. Oh yeah, it was packaged very securely and the toolkit it came with was very handy. There's also a video on YouTube for set up instructions. I would recommend 2 people complete the set up because the machine is heavy."

     "name": "THREE MONTH FOLLOW UP:\nHappy to say that this will be short because 3 months out weâre still very happy with this treadmill. Just as the booklet said, the belt stretches a bit with initial use so you have to adjust it to keep it tight. Itâs very easy to do and the tool that came with the treadmill is well designed and helpful. Zero issues with the treadmill at this point. Also (duh) we figured out that the distance is in km not miles so that explains why the distance seemed pretty off. It doesnât look like you can switch to miles but that doesnât matter to us. Weâre focused on time running more than distance. Plus we really should be using metric because the imperial system is just dumb.\nHereâs our detailed original review:\nThis is a review based on our first few days of ownership. I will update after a few months to report how the treadmill is holding up. Iâve broken the review down by subject.\nPackaging: We researched several different treadmills and one common issue for many was that the packaging didnât protect the treadmill in shipping which occasionally resulted in damage. Because treadmills are not easily returned, this is an issue. We noted that this was NOT a complaint with the Advenor treadmill, and ours arrived very well packed. Everything was protected and well secured.\nAssembly: Assembling the Abvenor treadmill was very easy and the instructions were clear and well written. One person could probably do it but two people will make it much faster and easier. All necessary tools were included and they were of surprisingly high quality. The Allen wrench has a grip and it is very helpful for adjusting the belt to ensure it is centered. That was also an easy thing to do. Centering the belt is critical because it avoids belt wear and will extend the life of the treadmill. Also included was lubricant that was well sealed and has a well designed applicator.\nQuality and Features: Given that we were spending less than $400 on this treadmill we went with a very simple display and simple features. I would be suspicious of an inexpensive treadmill with too many features and a fancy display. More features means higher build cost and at <$400, it means something is getting sacrificed elsewhere. The Advenor treadmill has a very basic digital display with all the basic information you need: time, distance, calories burned, and heart rate monitoring. It is also programmable for time. It may have other programmable features but so far weâve only set time and speed. The distance calculator seems off (too generous) but that doesnât matter - weâre focused on time running and checking heart rate here and there. The treadmill folds very easily and has a pneumatic lowering feature that is very nice. It fits perfectly against our home gym wall and is a great space saver. The treadmill has small wheels that enable one person to move it relatively easily. The build quality is good. As expected, itâs not as heavy duty as a professional gym treadmill but those are $2,000+ treadmills getting near constant use and they do not fold. The Advenor treadmill feels sturdy and solid for us (our family membersâ weight ranges from 115 lbs to 205 lbs). This is perfect for a home gym. It is comfortable to run on. One nitpick is that the cup holder sits at a bit of an angle but it hasnât been an issue with our water bottles. Just odd: it should be designed to hold the bottle straight up and down. The other holders are a good size and we can easily put our phones in a couple of spots. The display also has a holder that comfortably fits a phone or a small tablet in front of you if you want to watch videos while running.\nValue: Our initial impression is that this is a great low priced treadmill. Hopefully it will hold up over time. Weâll refresh our review in a few months to document how it is doing."

     "name": "Pros - The tread width is perfect. Easy to adjust the speeds. Easy to top and start. Many programs available. Foldable but somewhat heavy.\nCons - The start and stop buttons on the arms are too close to the pulse monitor. They could be moved up by and inch and would not be in the way. I find myself stopping it sometimes. Difficult to lube track. Unboxing: you need two two people to get it out of the box.\nFor me at 74 I just use it for walking and it's perfect for adjusting the speeds as you walk. I know there is plenty of speed for running.\n**I would definitely recommend this unit for walkers. I looked at many treadmills for two months and I'm happy I chose this one. Not disappointed."

    {
     "name": "Easy to assemble and has a slow safe let down feature.\nI wasnât expecting it to be as small as it is. Comparing it to the size of other treadmills at gyms this is definitely way smaller.\nBe mindful of the motor size 2.5. For my 13 year old itâs not bad running at a speed of 5 or 6. In order for my run to be effective I need to run at a speed of 8. Gym machines running at a speed of 6 kills me. If you are looking to have something as a starter machine or just basic walking this is the machine for you. If you are an avid runner or gym rat looking for a challenge it will disappoint you.\nIssues-Sometimes when using your hands to check pulse or to hold on itâs easy to hit the stop button. You cannot take really long strides so I wouldnât recommend it for tall people. Iâm 5â4 and I struggle. Itâs not super durable; my son misstepped and stepped on the bottom and it cracked even with the screw. I added photos to show what it should look like vs how it cracked. Be mindful the manufacturer sent me a product with zero damages. The machine is extremely delicate. There is ZERO incline.\nOVERALL: I think it is a decent machine. Iâm not disappointed with the purchase. I would recommend it for those who donât want to break the bank like myself and still be able to do some form running or walking."

So easy to use all the programs that cover a variety of desired exercises. Very quiet, very smooth operation. This is a very practical treadmill priced very well for the features it provides.\nBTW, before you go buying a good quality, best value for money home treadmill, check out this treadmill.

     "name": "I LOVE this little treadmill!!!!! Easy to assemble, the track does not need to be lubed or messed with. I paid 409 for it and came back two months later to write my review. I noticed it is now 379! What a deal!! I am a Walker/jogger/runner. When I read reviews I learned the importance of the horsepower of treadmills if you plan to run. I bought this in Late February. My husband and I both do about 4-6 miles a day each. We have only taken a few days off of excerise but this treadmill is amazing for a petite machine that has been used almost everyday for two months! Iâm so excited I have been losing weight, I can run at home and it takes up barely any space! I must tell you the mph, pulse and distance are not accurate at all! But I donât care about that because I track my pulse with a watch or pulse ox. Besides itâs the time of your excerise that matters not all the other numbers that will never be accurate on any machine. If you are looking for an affordable treadmill thatâs petite, packs power, not loud at all and is completely reliable this is your product! Iâm so so happy with it! Maybe equally as excited about my weight loss which I owe to my lil trusty Advenor!!! Donât forget to purchase a black gym mat to place under the machine. Not only does it add the quietness it looks good! I spent days reading reviews on treadmills and Iâm so glad I went with this petite 2.5 HP Advenor. I started off walking and now Iâm running 5 miles a day! Love Love Love it!!!!!"

     "name": "Nice and quiet machine. Works well. Don't trust the readings.\nI am an EMT, so I was concerned to see the pulse check to be HALF of where I actually was. I was told by Advenor staff that I should \"go to a professional medical institution for measurement\". So if you have a heart condition or high blood pressure, please use a different tool for measurement. This is not safe for folks in this case.\nHe also told me the MPH doesn't calibrate as well as the KMH, even though the majority of the people who purchased this machine are from the US. Example: In 25 minutes I ran 2 miles?! I was running fast (level 6) and it would take me anywhere from 17-19 minutes to reach 2 miles; which means the calibration is waaaaay off and it's not a \"little discrepancy.\" I understand this is a relatively cheap machine but these settings should be reflected accurately or close to, for health and safety reasons.\nFor those of you who may have the same questions or concerns, please see the email reply from Advenor below:\n1) The factory default speed of the treadmill is KMH. When you change the speed to MPH, there is a little tolerance in the programming when KMH is converted to MPH, so the distance value after a long run will show a little discrepancy from the actual distance.\n2)Please understand that this heart rate monitor is not a professional medical-grade heart rate measurement device, and the test results are not only related to personal constitution, but also may be affected by many factors. This value is for reference only. For more accurate heart rate data, please go to a professional medical institution for measurement.\nI'd return the machine but it's a beast of a return so I won't bother.\nThank you for reading. Take care."

I reached out to them via phone and they emailed me additional instructions immediately. Within minutes, I had it working. I super appreciate their kind, informative, and prompt reply. Here are my tips:\nMake sure the connector in the right arm base is attached.\nMake sure the two connectors at the top of the right arm are attached (they only attach in one way, one has five pins and one has four pins)\nIn my case, I had to unscrew the motor cover and attach a connection that came loose in shipping. Took two seconds, just had to know what I was looking for.\nI'm an amateur when it comes to cardio so the speed is perfect for me (I can lightly jog comfortably). It holds up well so far (no shaking, no rattling, no noise). Intuitive to use and easy to fold up and down. I'm pretty pleased so far."

It does record speed and distance in kilometers, but it can be changed to mph (I found out how by reading the Q & A). I suspect neither are accurate, but that isn't important to me. The pulse monitor isn't any good either. Once again, not important to me. All in all, if you're looking for an affordable, solid, well built treadmill for home use, I definitely recommend this one."

     "name": "When assembling this treadmill, I was impressed by the robust feel of the track and arms, as they are made entirely out of metal and high-quality plastic. I was slightly disappointed, then, to see that the quality dips with the center consoleâThe material feels sturdy enough, but Itâs left as a hollow shell with some of the wiring visible (granted, you wonât be able to see the wires or hollow bottom while running). The display panel is coated with a sort of glossy laminate that feels alright, but looks cheap when caught by the light because itâs slightly warped or peeling in some places.\nRevisiting the track, I noticed that the rubber is wrinkled where they had to meld the ends together to make a continuous loop. It looks taught everywhere else.\nMy final criticism is that the whenever you press something, the console makes a high-pitched, obnoxious beeping sound. Would be better quieter and lower-pitched.\nAll of that being said, I didnât exactly expect supreme quality at such a low price, and the machine seems to work."

But anyways, with a little bit of ingenuity and some electrical tape I got it to work, just not an ideal solution.\n*\nUpdate:\nThe company proactively reached out to me to offer some assistance due to the broken clip so based on the excellent customer service I am updating this to 5 stars!"

I mostly use my treadmill for power walking/jogging. I'm not sure if this treadmill would work for someone that is more of a runner or a tall person. I'm 5'0\" and when I do \"run\" I feel like I there's just enough space for my little legs, but not sure if a taller person would have enough space. I also wish the treadmill folded completely, but that was my error in not researching more. I've included pictures of the treadmill folded for reference.

Things that I don't like, The arms are too narrow, depending on your height, running can be hard for arm placement. If walking its not any better (taller is better if running) the track isn't very long, so if you have a long stide it gets tricky next the cup holder is too small. It is not very big none of my sports bottle fit in it. Last the wheels are on the back side of bottom rails. So either run facing wall, have it in the middle of a room, or try and wiggle behind it and push it away from the wall.\nThe quality is better than I have had of similar price. I would buy again and recommend it."

If you want something easy for basic exercise, this is a good machine to buy.\nThis was pretty easy to assemble solo. I guess you get what you pay for. This treadmill feels cheap, and is so loud. I wanted to use this with my tray for my laptop for work, but I canât even hear myself think. Itâs a combination of the motor and the belt. I am hoping the rest of the lubricant helps soften it.

It was very easy to assemble (my husband and I had it together in 30 min), it is super quiet, and ticks all the boxes for my walking needs. I walk around 3-4 miles/day, and it logs my speed, time, calories burned and miles walked (my readings started in miles, not kilometers). It gets very hot in the summer where I live, and I really needed to be able to exercise indoors (still cannot get to the gym). The one thing that is missing in the directions is where the on/off button is.......it is on the base frame of the treadmill at the front (not on the console)....it sounds silly, but it needs to be shown in the âname of partsâ. It semi-folds easily, but is a little harder to move. There is a shelf for an ipad, so I listen to music or binge-watch a show and just go. You absolutely cannot beat the price!

It would have been a lot more challenging with just one person though as it did have some bigger and heavier parts that would have been harder to maneuver or hold with just one.

Also itâs a bit small so you canât take big steps because the width is very limited. Neither of those things are a problem for me since I am a petite person and this works out for me.

I am 5â5â ~120 lbs and it fits me fine, but for a larger/taller person it might be challenging. Easy to use and perfect for a simple at home gym. Comfortable cushion on the running base. Love the water bottle holder too (lots of treadmills in this price range donât have them). Only downside Iâve noticed (other than size) is the mph/speed is not at all comparable to larger models (in traditional gyms, etc). For example, I is usually start running/comfortable jog at a 5.0 to warm up at the gym. On this treadmill, my warm up speed was an 8.0 on this machine (max available is 13.0 on this machine). And the treadmill calculates distance run off of speed, so it was drastically overestimating how far I actually ran. It doesnât bother me too much cause I can just use my Apple Watch for distance, but just something to be aware of. Otherwise, itâs a good product for the price."

The final deciding factor was that many reviews mentioned it was SECURELY PACKAGED. Many others brands had good potenial - but reviews often stated treadmills were busted upon arrival due to poor packaging. This made me crazy!! So I took a chance on this fairly new treadmill company-- and could not be happier! Safely packaged-- well built/ sturdy -- quiet-- belt wide and long enough. Easy to fold / unfold-- maybe not super easy to roll around but I keep mine in place. Have put 2 rugs underneath instead of a matt. Good customer service was also imperative for peace of mind --which was positively mentioned in many reviews. Have enjoyed it daily for short walks since December 1st. Hope it lasts a very long time. It definitely checks all my boxes. So far, so good! I hope this review can be helpful. Way to go, Advenor!"

The legs for folding the unit are held up by a piston that is supposed to collapse. It didnât. I contacted the company, and they promised to send a new part. Three weeks later I disconnect the piston. There is very tight clearance to put in certain screws and nuts\nOverall I like the unit but assembly is difficult"

It has a great manual incline as well as programs that will fit whatever workout routine you may be needing.

I feel worked out every run or walk I take. Worth the price and buy. I do not regret purchasing. In fact I can not say no to a workout or have any excuses to not workout with this in my house. I love it and am starting to see more results with each use."

We haven't tried folding it as we are using it everyday."

We bought it for my sister, assembled it at our place, and delivered it to her. Super happy with our purchase!"

Me and my family use it almost everyday for more than two weeks already. We have 4 people used it. And We didnât find anything bad till now."

They can start it and do the controls without any confusion. (11& 12 year olds). It is not bulky at all. I would definitely recommend it!"

     "name": "I am 58 years old, overweight, and have just been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes. Talk about a wake-up call. I have been advised to walk 30 minutes per day at least 4 times per week. My husband is going through health problems (CLL / leukemia, and extreme Iron deficiency, which leaves me unable to leave home to do my walking. I researched many Treadmills before deciding to purchase this one. Here are the reasons I chose this machine. #1-price was reasonable, #2-machine takes up less room than most other Treadmills, #3-machine is wider than all others I looked at, #4-handlebars are longer, with start / stop on buttons left side bar and increase / decrease buttons on right side bar, which makes it very easy to get to whenever you need to make adjustments, or stop. (I read where some people did not like this feature because it was where you naturally place your hands, so they accidentally turn machine off. This is partly true, but that is 1 of the reasons I chose this machine. The Heart rate monitor is directly below these buttons, so that is where you keep your hands.) If you are or plan to be a power walker or runner, this machine is not for you, it only goes up to 4 miles per hour. However, I will never power walk or run, so 4 miles per hour is faster than I will ever need. Why pay extra money for more machine than you need. #5-Display is easy to read, #6-info said this machine is quiet. That is an understatement. I talk with my husband while walking, without raising my voice, I watch T.V. without needing to turn volume up at all. It is unbelievably quiet, and #7-I really like the safety clip. This one has one end that clips to your clothes like a clothespin, the other end that attaches to the machine is a magnet, making it easy to pull away from machine quickly, in case of an accidental fall, very good safety feature.\nBox is very heavy. You will need 2 people to get box moved and in place. Once machine is out of box, it is a 1 person job to mount control panel and move to desired location. Wheels are very small, and you may be like us, at first we thought they we not in box. They are attached to frame, so even though they are small, they work well. The box was delivered with damage, however, machine was in perfect condition, due to proper protection inside of box. I have told everyone I know, buy this Treadmill. Now I am telling you. Happy Walking.\nP.S. I forgot to tell you, I have walked 30 minutes per day, every single day, since I have had this Treadmill. I love it!"

     "name": "I am a 300+ pound middle-aged man with back and leg problems due to a number of blown discs over the years. I have a fair amount of trouble walking, so I wanted to try to increase my coordination and stamina with a treadmill. I was a little skeptical about this product given the price but decided it was worth the risk, given the price of the average \"name brand\" unit. I'm glad I did.\nThis thing is rather amazingly solid for something of its size/price. The design is quite clever in its use of leverage to buoy up the overall sturdiness and rigidity; the \"C\" shape of the floor supports, uprights and grab bars, coupled with the low center of gravity, means that the thing moves around very little during use. It's also pretty quiet: the frame creaked and groaned a little when I first started using it but adjusting the floor shims and skooctching the thing around on the floor a little allowed it to settle in. The grab bars are nice and long, a real necessity in my case. The only other treadmills I found on Amazon with bars of equal or greater length cost a great deal more. Like every treadmill made since the beginning of time, the control panel sits way too far forward of the \"upstream\" end of the belt....apparently these things are primarily designed for use by people with the arm-length-to-body-height ratio of an orangutan. The little cubbies on either side of the control face are great for storing spare change or perhaps a cigarette lighter, but are useless for anything larger. No big deal, I used Velcro to slap my tablet, stereo remote and other gadgets all over the thing, and you can always zip-tie a holster for a water bottle to the frame somewhere. I'm seriously thinking of disabling the grab-bar-mounted controls, as they are placed where I tend to want to put my hands, but that's going to be different for everyone. Fortunately the controls are joined to the control panel by a wire harness, so I ought to be able to pull the plug on them if I decide I want to.\nAmazing, huh? Yes. This is a great product. However, I am deducting two stars for the company's hilariously underwhelming customer service.\nIn the process of jiggering with the belt tensioners (a tip for new users: if you need to retension the belt, put the belt in its vertical \"stored\" position first. That way the retensioners are right at eye level, and you can easily look at the whole of the belt while making the adjustments), I overstressed and cracked one of the caps that cover the back ends of the foot rails. They are purely decorative, but I thought I would order a replacement, and while I was at it, ask the customer service representative about the retensioning processâhow tight is too tight, etc. I called the toll-free number (nice touch), and was greeted by the worst, I mean the w o r s t voice-chip phone greeting I have ever heard in my life. If you are a fan of South Park, think of the voice of the \"Shake Weight\" in that episode. Its cadence and pronunciation were actually a little nauseating to listen to. I'm imagining that the owner of the company bought a turn-key hardware/software telephony package and decided to use the default voice-synth option rather than recording an outgoing message him/herself....bad move. The voice warbled at me that all CSRs were busy and that if I left my name and number someone would get back to me, so I did. Now a week later, and I have yet to hear from anyone....and I even mentioned in my message that I wanted to buy replacement partsâthat is to say, that I wanted to spend more money with them.\nThis is the dark flip-side of this amazing Information Age in which we live. The ability to asses a company before you buy their wares has diminished considerably. It is entirely possible for a single person to masquerade as a complete business, with all of the attendant infrastructure. Even an impressive Web site is just a matter of a few dollars and several hours' worth of dragging and dropping. I get the feeling that \"Paradigm Health & Wellness\" is one person sitting in an attached-garage office in a residential neighborhood, with maybe a decommissioned 20-foot shipping container for a \"warehouse.\" I could very well be wrong, but nothing in my experience to date has suggested otherwise.\nWould I recommend buying one of these treadmills? Yes, I would; I'm very impressed with mine. But keep the packaging for the first two weeks, and maybe take pictures of the unit as packaged before assembling it so you'll know how to get it back in the box. If you have any issues, you're going to want to avail yourself of Amazon's generous return policy, because I'm not sure you will have any other options."

     "name": "This treadmill only gets 1-star because of the complete and total lack of customer support from the manufacturer.\nThe treadmill arrived in a very big and heavy box. The box had some minor scrapes and gouges, but it was heavy-duty cardboard with reinforcements in the corners. There was no damage to the contents.\nI was able to unpack and assemble the treadmill with no assistance, but it was a challenge to get it out of the box, especially in the small, crowded living room in which it was going (I'm a 63-year old slightly overweight senior male). The assembly instructions were pretty much worthless, but what little assembly was needed was pretty obvious.\nThe treadmill seems very well made and sturdy. My wife has been using it for an hour a day for two weeks now without any problems. The motor and belt are very quiet, and it is easy to listen to the TV without having to crank up the volume. The treadmill is short and relatively compact -- a feature we needed -- but neither my wife nor I have any trouble with staying in the main tread area and any of its speeds. The belt is wide and there is plenty of room between the hand rails for arms to swing (and neither of us are skinny). The long side arms do not get in the way, and are essential for my wife who occasionally has some balance problems. The control buttons on the side arms are convenient, and we quickly learned where to position our hands so as to not inadvertently hit them.\nThe two pockets in the console are worthless. The would be deep enough to hold things like a TV remote or water bottle, but are at such a steep angle that anything put in them vibrates out within seconds when the treadmill is being used. Fortunately, I have a pedal desk (also made by Paradigm Health and Wellness) sitting right next to the treadmill, that has very useful holders for a TV remote and bottle of water.\nThe treadmill is plastered with very large, obnoxious legal warning stickers that are a ghastly red, orange or yellow. It is impossible to remove the stickers without damaging the paint or plastic parts. It would seem that the manufacturer, Paradigm Health and Wellness, is owned and operated by paranoid lawyers who are certain that anyone who even looks at the treadmill is going to sue them. This treadmill sits in our living room, and these unsightly legal warning stickers are a major eyesore.\nThe reason for the 1-star review is because my wife called Paradigm's customer support number with a simple question. There is a funny looking symbol on the display with a \"T\" inside a circle and a number next to it that varies between 19 and 21 during her workout. The mode button and other controls have no effect on this part of the display. The very short owner's manual does not talk about the display at all, and we cannot figure out what \"T 19\" could possible mean. My wife has tried calling the customer support number in the owner's multiple times and only gets an answering machine telling her to leave a message and a support person will call back. We have not received a call back after two weeks.\nI cannot recommend buying a product, no matter how good it is, if the company that makes it does not provide customer support.\nUPDATE 3/30/17: We have now had this treadmill for a month. My wife uses it 3 to 4 days a week for 45 minutes each time. After 3 weeks, the treadmill started going berserk. While in use, it would suddenly speed up to its max speed. Holding down the minus button for the speed would slow the treadmill down, but as soon as the button was released it would speed back up again. This would happen several times before the treadmill would final stay at the slower speed. Turning the treadmill off and on, would not help. As soon as it was turned on again, it would race up to its maximum speed. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD! My wife has leg problems, and cannot walk at the max speed of the treadmill. When it would suddenly speed up, she was be thrown off the back of treadmill more than once if she was not able to step onto the side platforms quickly enough.\nI found that the problem is a design and manufacturing defect. The foam tube on the left side hand rail can slide on the steel pipe. The foam had slid down into the speed control switch on the handrail, and caused the UP speed button to stick. I had to loosen the set screw underneath the speed switch, and slide the foam back to its original position (it had only slipped about 1/2 inch). The UP speed button would then function correctly. I have fixed it temporarily by putting a zip-tie around the tube at its furthest forward spot. That has prevented the tube from slipping so far, but the zip-tie end is in the way when holding the railing where it is located.\nOther reviewers have reported this same type of failure with this treadmill. The failure should be well-known to the manufacturer, Paradigm Health & Wellness, but they do not seem to be inclined to fix this problem. Paradigm Health & Wellness needs to send customers a proper fix for this problem with the foam tubing slipping before they get SUED!\nParadigm Health customer support has still not responded to my initial call for support, noted in my original review. After 30 days, however, Paradigm Health did send an automated e-mail saying they were closing the support call as being resolved. This company still deserves less than a 1-star review because of their total lack of support and concern for their customers."

     "name": "About a year ago, I decided to try and change my lifestyle and lose weight. Weighing 341 pounds and on the wrong side of 40, part of my plan included adding exercise to my daily routine. So I bought a treadmill. This treadmill, specifically due to it's competitive price point and it's generous 400-pound weight limit.\nOne year later, I feel compelled to submit one of the only reviews I've ever submitted for a product on Amazon. I've lost 102 pounds in the last year and this treadmill has been with me on this journey every step of the way. I've beaten the hell out of it, if I'm honest. I think you can imagine the force a 300+ pound man is going to apply on a piece of exercise equipment he's using daily. And the treadmill is clearly showing some wear and tear for sure. The motor is a fair bit louder now than it was back then, the belt squeaks sometimes when you start it up, and occasionally the treadmill will shut down every once in awhile with an \"E09\" error code that isn't explained in the manual.\nBut noises and the random error code aside, I can't complain. The frame is still as solid as the day I got it - not even a hint of shake. The motor is still running as good as it ever did. Other than some slight wear along the edges, the belt is in amazingly good shape. I can't speak to the customer service, as I haven't used it. All I can tell you is that this thing is as durable as anything I've ever owned."

     "name": "Given our experience with this product, I thought I would share it with others.\nUPS delivery to your door. Recognize that the box is 60â long, 36â wide and 13â high. It is big. The treadmill itself weighs 120 lbs, add the box and packing material and you are looking at 130 lbs you have to move. You will need two strong people to move the box. If you must go up a stairway (heaven help you), maybe three people. I can see no physical way one person can move this box, put the unit together and then move the unit by themselves. You will need help, someone with muscles and mechanical skills for assembly.\nOur box arrived damaged, like someone used a box cutter and cut across the middle of the box. The only obvious damaged was one of the plastic âHandlebar Knobsâ with half the knob you turn broken off. Still usable.\nOne of the first things you need to decide is whether you will move the unopened box into the room where the treadmill will be located, or assemble the treadmill in say a garage, and then carry the folded treadmill (2 people) to the room. My wife and I messed up and took the box cover off and decided to move the open box to the room. So we needed to use rope around the opened box to hold the unit in the box, raised the box up on its long side, and using towels to protect the floor and ease of sliding, pushed and slid the box into the room where the treadmill was going to be located, about 50 feet from the garage on the same floor. Knowing what I know now, I would have assembled the unit in the garage and then we would have folded the unit as it can be folded, and then carried the folded unit to the room. Live and learn!\nAssembly: I would strongly recommend that the ProGear/Paradigm Health and Wellness people bring in customers who are unfamiliar with the unit and watch them follow the âassembly instructionsâ and the problems they encounter. The instructions were obviously written by someone who knows the unit, knows how it goes together. The company needs to bring in people totally unfamiliar with the unit, like two 70 year olds, show them the sealed box and watch what they do and the problems they have, never helping them, then rewrite the assembly instructions and add a few extra diagrams. Step 1 of the instructions is totally worthless. My wife and I, college educated, sat looking at the unit once it was out of the box and could not figure out how to execute the first part of Step 1, âPlace the treadmill in the upright positionâ as it does not show effectively how to expand the unit coming right out of the box. It took us almost an hour of looking and experimenting before we thought we knew what to do. And then a problem occurred with one of the spring-loaded knobs that was jammed in its hole, possibly another result of the damaged box. Step 1 is woefully inadequate to instruct a customer on how to expand the machine out of the box. We believe we have the unit assembled as required, but are not sure given the poor Step 1 instructions.\nSteps 2-4 were easy to follow, but the diagram in Step 3 is confusing. It shows that the console and the wires going into the base unit need to be connected. However, our consoleâs wires were already connected. One real challenge, the console sits loose in the box, connected to the base unit only by wires. As you are taking the unit out of the box and expanding it per Step 1, the console is dangling free and we were concerned the connections for the wires, not real robust, would break free. We taped the console to the back handlebar to avoid this, and then removed the tape when we started bolting the console to the console bracket.\nOperation and Quality: Once assembled, the unit presents a very strong and sturdy piece of exercise equipment comparable to units 2 or 3 times its cost. The unit began operating as expected, and my wife used it this morning for a full 30-minute walk and had no problems. It is very quiet. You could easily watch TV and walk without having the TV sound turned way up. We did notice that the safety tether is a little short if she walks in the middle of the treadmill. It could have another 6 inches to avoid being disconnected by accident. As a future enhancement, we would ask the manufacturer to add a stop switch on the right handlebar by the speed control. Reaching forward to hit the stop button on the console for people with short arms is a challenge.\nIf I ignore the assembly challenges, the quality and performance after 1 day are quite good for a $400+ walking treadmill. I would give this unit a rating of 5 stars, but I would give the very poor assembly instructions 1 star. But quality and performance outweigh the temporary assembly issues, the reason for the 4 star rating. Just remember, this is a two person job, moving the box, assembling the unit, and then moving the assembled unit to its final position."

     "name": "I have never used a treadmill before and didnât think I would. When I would see one at a friends home, it dominated the entire room. But when my husband came home from the hospital he needed to getting moving again so I started to search for a dreaded treadmill. I have been pleasantly surprised by this machine. It is sturdy yet not dominating. It was easy for me a 67 year old lady to assemble (not to easy to move as the box was large and heavy). The suggestion to use the packing materials to help set it up was genius. My husband is using the machine several times a day because I have it behind the sofa. It is shorter than the sofa so we can walk around it easily. I would recommend this model for anyone who needs to get up off the chair and get moving. Itâs safe and reliable."

     "name": "The worse instruction's manuel for assembly I've ever come across. I think it was written by a 5th grader. I take that back, don't want to insult 5th graders, they could probably do a better job. The drawing illustrations are horrible and very difficult to understand, instructions are confusing and difficult to follow. There are two pieces needed for folding the thread mill, a safety tube and the air piston, and they're not even mentioned in the instructions and how to install them. Had to use common sense to figure it out. The thread mill comes practically unassembled with the exception of the handrails, everything else you have to put together, and with the horrible badly written instructions manuel it was difficult to put together. Good thing I have plenty of experience putting things together which helped me get through it. It's very heavy, and not easy to move around, even when folded for storage, it's still bulky and doesn't maneuver easily. If you're not experienced in putting things together, I wouldn't recommend you attempt this assembly on your own. You need strength, energy, common sense, and patients. The upside, once put together and running, it does operate smooth and very quite, the computer is easy to operate, and the controls button on the handrails to control speed, on/off switch and speed are a nice feature. And by holding the handrails with both hands over the pulse censor, keeps track of your heart rate. It was too bad, I had to have a bad experience with the horrible instructions manuel, and difficulty of putting it together before I could enjoy it."

After a week I paid to have this piece of junk hauled off because I don't have room to have something this large wasting space in my home. After OVER a week, they contact me, tell me if I ship it back they can refund me (most people aren't going to keep defective and useless products sitting indefinitely). I informed them I just had it shipped of to the dump, was told \"oh, nevermind, we assumed you'd keep up junk trashing up your home for a while, bye\". Yeah, so their customer support is as horrible as their products. Spend your money elsewhere.\nEDIT: Just to include a pic of the broken roller. Treadmill supposed to be rated for 400 lbs, yet 220 lbs caused that breakage so you can figure out yourself based on the weight you're at how much you'd trust it.\nWith light use, regular maintenance, died about 2 1/2 years in. Which is insanely low for a treadmill (our last one lasted 9 years). Would NOT recommend the brand.\nI've been on treadmills that were not motor driven that were more sturdily built. This one didn't even have the guide on it to keep the belt on track (probably what led to the insanely short time before it met an end), so you'd have to constantly adjust the belt one way or the other, even when you got it perfect, next time you use it it would go back off center again and need adjusted. Pathetic."

It seems to get louder the faster this treadmill runs. I've gone to the website of my ProGear HCXL 4000 Treadmill where they have \"Live Assist\". After waiting 15 minutes it appeared no one was mining that area. Also, there does not seem to be a working forum where I can contact other users to see if any are having the same situation and what they do to eradicate the problem. The knocking noise sound serious to me. I'm just hoping the treadmill is not ready to be trashed. I am convinced there is no customer service assist. I have not been able to contact anyone from the company regarding my problem with this treadmill. Has anyone else had a problem with this product and was able to contact customer service? Before I purchased this product, I checked out many of the reviews here and then decided to buy. I am convinced buying a product such as this may not be the best choice. The only way to have repairs done is have someone come to our home since this item is too heavy to load in the SUV. We may have to end up calling our local Salvation Army to come pick this up as a donation. It only held up for one year and that's not good at all."

The remainder of the assembly went according to directions. The adjuster pads that go on the bottom of the stabilizer need to be installed before use; turn on side. Total assembly time was about 2 hours. Missing bolts for the bracket for the computer control panel. When finally assembled, the arm rests and vertical frame are somewhat loose, and no further adjustment."

I had arranged for a friend to be available to help move this gigantic 150 lb box into the house, instead I struggled to do it myself. It was a bit rough to put together. A suggestion would be to attach the computer part to the top rail at the earliest possible time to prevent it from dangling and being bounced around possibly loosening connections. The tread was moving to one side and as I attempted to make adjustments was just not sure the directions were correct. Beware, this machine may fold up and be portable but don't think that if you have company coming you can move it from the livingroom to the bedroom out of the way. It is too wide to roll through a doorway unless perhaps a handicap doorframe is wide enough. Still, I am happy with the product and it seems very sturdy for a large person.

Unfortunately, when I actually tried to start the treadmill belt, it moves about 2 feet and then the display shows \"Er5\". I followed the manual's troubleshooting instructions for this error with no success.\nThe manual indicated that the likely cause of the \"Er5\" error was either a bad motor or a bad Power IC Board. I attempted to contact ParadigmHW.Com (parent company for ProGear) for support via their website AND via email, then waited for two weeks (they promise a 1-2 day response time) and got NO response other than an automated email that my message had been received.\nIn a last-ditch attempt to repair the unit, I submitted a third support request asking specifically for the Power IC Board (I'm just guessing this is the problem, since the motor appears undamaged) to be replaced under warranty. After three days (the site promises a 1-2 day response time) I have still not received any response other than the \"we received your request\" automated response.\nNot only did the unit arrive non-functional, but the technical support is literally non-existent.

The tubes must be round before the bottom support legs can be inserted.

They only warranty the parts. When we set it up there was a clunking noise every time we tried to walk on it. I contacted the vendor and sent a audio recording of the noise and they said it probably was a bearing in either the front or back roller. They would happily send me new rollers. When I inquired if they had people in the area that installed them they said no that's up to you. Brand-new machine with a problem with the bearings in one of the rollers and their solutions were one to send me the rollers and have me figure out how to put them in. They do have a video on how to get them out that they will send you a link to. Their other option was I could return the treadmill to Amazon because I was with in my 90 days. To do that I would have to take the treadmill part find some way to wrap it up since I had recycled the box it came in already and then get it someplace to ship it. Hopefully I wouldn't have to pay for the shipping. When the rollers came they did not have any directions for installing them.

It was easy to unpack and without blemish. (Ladies, you definitely need help though. Don't try this alone.)\nThat's my review! If my opinion changes over time, I'll let you know."

Downfalls for me are that the hand rails are a little too long, so if your elbows aren't bent your hands whack them.

She is not a runner, but being 5' 2\" she could probably do a light jog at 4mph if she wanted too. That would be a very brisk walk for me being over 6'. Picking the unit up from Walmart was easy, and the employees helped me load it in my truck. The box is big, almost 6ft long because of the packaging, so you will need a decent vehicle to pick this up with. I use a pickup truck, but maybe an SUV with the seats down might work well too? Getting it inside and set up is definitely a two person job, only due to the weight of the unit. I personally brought it up three flights and set it up inside our condo by myself, but I'm a beast who hits the gym regularly, and no one was around to help me today. Setup was easy, and I place it on a treadmill mat. This extends the life of the unit by protecting the motor from dust, and hopefully saves the carpet too. I did have to adjust the alignment of the belt just a hair, was to the right a bit, but was really simple following the instructions in the enclosed manual. I feel this was a decent purchase for the price in comparison to high-end units that I've seen being sold for thousands.

It was definitely time to replace it. I realized I didn't need a treadmill for running, I walk. So I looked for one that had a wider deck that was not necessarily made for a big running stride.\nThe deck on this unit is comfortably wide and long enough. When you use it on the greater incline it may seem too short, but on the flat setting it feels longer.\nI love the longer side handles. There is room for it if I want to add a desk. I also really like the controls on the handles. The pulse monitor isn't accurate, but I use the fitness watch for that.\nSo far, I am pleased with this purchase."

My husband is going through health problems (CLL / leukemia, and extreme Iron deficiency, which leaves me unable to leave home to do my walking. I researched many Treadmills before deciding to purchase this one. Here are the reasons I chose this machine. #1-price was reasonable, #2-machine takes up less room than most other Treadmills, #3-machine is wider than all others I looked at, #4-handlebars are longer, with start / stop on buttons left side bar and increase / decrease buttons on right side bar, which makes it very easy to get to whenever you need to make adjustments, or stop. (I read where some people did not like this feature because it was where you naturally place your hands, so they accidentally turn machine off. This is partly true, but that is 1 of the reasons I chose this machine. The Heart rate monitor is directly below these buttons, so that is where you keep your hands.) If you are or plan to be a power walker or runner, this machine is not for you, it only goes up to 4 miles per hour. However, I will never power walk or run, so 4 miles per hour is faster than I will ever need. Why pay extra money for more machine than you need. #5-Display is easy to read, #6-info said this machine is quiet. That is an understatement. I talk with my husband while walking, without raising my voice, I watch T.V. without needing to turn volume up at all. It is unbelievably quiet, and #7-I really like the safety clip. This one has one end that clips to your clothes like a clothespin, the other end that attaches to the machine is a magnet, making it easy to pull away from machine quickly, in case of an accidental fall, very good safety feature.\nBox is very heavy. You will need 2 people to get box moved and in place. Once machine is out of box, it is a 1 person job to mount control panel and move to desired location. Wheels are very small, and you may be like us, at first we thought they we not in box. They are attached to frame, so even though they are small, they work well. The box was delivered with damage, however, machine was in perfect condition, due to proper protection inside of box. I have told everyone I know, buy this Treadmill. Now I am telling you. Happy Walking.\nP.S. I forgot to tell you, I have walked 30 minutes per day, every single day, since I have had this Treadmill. I love it!"

     "name": "I am a 300+ pound middle-aged man with back and leg problems due to a number of blown discs over the years. I have a fair amount of trouble walking, so I wanted to try to increase my coordination and stamina with a treadmill. I was a little skeptical about this product given the price but decided it was worth the risk, given the price of the average \"name brand\" unit. I'm glad I did.\nThis thing is rather amazingly solid for something of its size/price. The design is quite clever in its use of leverage to buoy up the overall sturdiness and rigidity; the \"C\" shape of the floor supports, uprights and grab bars, coupled with the low center of gravity, means that the thing moves around very little during use. It's also pretty quiet: the frame creaked and groaned a little when I first started using it but adjusting the floor shims and skooctching the thing around on the floor a little allowed it to settle in. The grab bars are nice and long, a real necessity in my case. The only other treadmills I found on Amazon with bars of equal or greater length cost a great deal more. Like every treadmill made since the beginning of time, the control panel sits way too far forward of the \"upstream\" end of the belt....apparently these things are primarily designed for use by people with the arm-length-to-body-height ratio of an orangutan. The little cubbies on either side of the control face are great for storing spare change or perhaps a cigarette lighter, but are useless for anything larger. No big deal, I used Velcro to slap my tablet, stereo remote and other gadgets all over the thing, and you can always zip-tie a holster for a water bottle to the frame somewhere. I'm seriously thinking of disabling the grab-bar-mounted controls, as they are placed where I tend to want to put my hands, but that's going to be different for everyone. Fortunately the controls are joined to the control panel by a wire harness, so I ought to be able to pull the plug on them if I decide I want to.\nAmazing, huh? Yes. This is a great product. However, I am deducting two stars for the company's hilariously underwhelming customer service.\nIn the process of jiggering with the belt tensioners (a tip for new users: if you need to retension the belt, put the belt in its vertical \"stored\" position first. That way the retensioners are right at eye level, and you can easily look at the whole of the belt while making the adjustments), I overstressed and cracked one of the caps that cover the back ends of the foot rails. They are purely decorative, but I thought I would order a replacement, and while I was at it, ask the customer service representative about the retensioning processâhow tight is too tight, etc. I called the toll-free number (nice touch), and was greeted by the worst, I mean the w o r s t voice-chip phone greeting I have ever heard in my life. If you are a fan of South Park, think of the voice of the \"Shake Weight\" in that episode. Its cadence and pronunciation were actually a little nauseating to listen to. I'm imagining that the owner of the company bought a turn-key hardware/software telephony package and decided to use the default voice-synth option rather than recording an outgoing message him/herself....bad move. The voice warbled at me that all CSRs were busy and that if I left my name and number someone would get back to me, so I did. Now a week later, and I have yet to hear from anyone....and I even mentioned in my message that I wanted to buy replacement partsâthat is to say, that I wanted to spend more money with them.\nThis is the dark flip-side of this amazing Information Age in which we live. The ability to asses a company before you buy their wares has diminished considerably. It is entirely possible for a single person to masquerade as a complete business, with all of the attendant infrastructure. Even an impressive Web site is just a matter of a few dollars and several hours' worth of dragging and dropping. I get the feeling that \"Paradigm Health & Wellness\" is one person sitting in an attached-garage office in a residential neighborhood, with maybe a decommissioned 20-foot shipping container for a \"warehouse.\" I could very well be wrong, but nothing in my experience to date has suggested otherwise.\nWould I recommend buying one of these treadmills? Yes, I would; I'm very impressed with mine. But keep the packaging for the first two weeks, and maybe take pictures of the unit as packaged before assembling it so you'll know how to get it back in the box. If you have any issues, you're going to want to avail yourself of Amazon's generous return policy, because I'm not sure you will have any other options."

     "name": "This treadmill only gets 1-star because of the complete and total lack of customer support from the manufacturer.\nThe treadmill arrived in a very big and heavy box. The box had some minor scrapes and gouges, but it was heavy-duty cardboard with reinforcements in the corners. There was no damage to the contents.\nI was able to unpack and assemble the treadmill with no assistance, but it was a challenge to get it out of the box, especially in the small, crowded living room in which it was going (I'm a 63-year old slightly overweight senior male). The assembly instructions were pretty much worthless, but what little assembly was needed was pretty obvious.\nThe treadmill seems very well made and sturdy. My wife has been using it for an hour a day for two weeks now without any problems. The motor and belt are very quiet, and it is easy to listen to the TV without having to crank up the volume. The treadmill is short and relatively compact -- a feature we needed -- but neither my wife nor I have any trouble with staying in the main tread area and any of its speeds. The belt is wide and there is plenty of room between the hand rails for arms to swing (and neither of us are skinny). The long side arms do not get in the way, and are essential for my wife who occasionally has some balance problems. The control buttons on the side arms are convenient, and we quickly learned where to position our hands so as to not inadvertently hit them.\nThe two pockets in the console are worthless. The would be deep enough to hold things like a TV remote or water bottle, but are at such a steep angle that anything put in them vibrates out within seconds when the treadmill is being used. Fortunately, I have a pedal desk (also made by Paradigm Health and Wellness) sitting right next to the treadmill, that has very useful holders for a TV remote and bottle of water.\nThe treadmill is plastered with very large, obnoxious legal warning stickers that are a ghastly red, orange or yellow. It is impossible to remove the stickers without damaging the paint or plastic parts. It would seem that the manufacturer, Paradigm Health and Wellness, is owned and operated by paranoid lawyers who are certain that anyone who even looks at the treadmill is going to sue them. This treadmill sits in our living room, and these unsightly legal warning stickers are a major eyesore.\nThe reason for the 1-star review is because my wife called Paradigm's customer support number with a simple question. There is a funny looking symbol on the display with a \"T\" inside a circle and a number next to it that varies between 19 and 21 during her workout. The mode button and other controls have no effect on this part of the display. The very short owner's manual does not talk about the display at all, and we cannot figure out what \"T 19\" could possible mean. My wife has tried calling the customer support number in the owner's multiple times and only gets an answering machine telling her to leave a message and a support person will call back. We have not received a call back after two weeks.\nI cannot recommend buying a product, no matter how good it is, if the company that makes it does not provide customer support.\nUPDATE 3/30/17: We have now had this treadmill for a month. My wife uses it 3 to 4 days a week for 45 minutes each time. After 3 weeks, the treadmill started going berserk. While in use, it would suddenly speed up to its max speed. Holding down the minus button for the speed would slow the treadmill down, but as soon as the button was released it would speed back up again. This would happen several times before the treadmill would final stay at the slower speed. Turning the treadmill off and on, would not help. As soon as it was turned on again, it would race up to its maximum speed. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD! My wife has leg problems, and cannot walk at the max speed of the treadmill. When it would suddenly speed up, she was be thrown off the back of treadmill more than once if she was not able to step onto the side platforms quickly enough.\nI found that the problem is a design and manufacturing defect. The foam tube on the left side hand rail can slide on the steel pipe. The foam had slid down into the speed control switch on the handrail, and caused the UP speed button to stick. I had to loosen the set screw underneath the speed switch, and slide the foam back to its original position (it had only slipped about 1/2 inch). The UP speed button would then function correctly. I have fixed it temporarily by putting a zip-tie around the tube at its furthest forward spot. That has prevented the tube from slipping so far, but the zip-tie end is in the way when holding the railing where it is located.\nOther reviewers have reported this same type of failure with this treadmill. The failure should be well-known to the manufacturer, Paradigm Health & Wellness, but they do not seem to be inclined to fix this problem. Paradigm Health & Wellness needs to send customers a proper fix for this problem with the foam tubing slipping before they get SUED!\nParadigm Health customer support has still not responded to my initial call for support, noted in my original review. After 30 days, however, Paradigm Health did send an automated e-mail saying they were closing the support call as being resolved. This company still deserves less than a 1-star review because of their total lack of support and concern for their customers."

Weighing 341 pounds and on the wrong side of 40, part of my plan included adding exercise to my daily routine. So I bought a treadmill. This treadmill, specifically due to it's competitive price point and it's generous 400-pound weight limit.\nOne year later, I feel compelled to submit one of the only reviews I've ever submitted for a product on Amazon. I've lost 102 pounds in the last year and this treadmill has been with me on this journey every step of the way. I've beaten the hell out of it, if I'm honest. I think you can imagine the force a 300+ pound man is going to apply on a piece of exercise equipment he's using daily. And the treadmill is clearly showing some wear and tear for sure. The motor is a fair bit louder now than it was back then, the belt squeaks sometimes when you start it up, and occasionally the treadmill will shut down every once in awhile with an \"E09\" error code that isn't explained in the manual.\nBut noises and the random error code aside, I can't complain. The frame is still as solid as the day I got it - not even a hint of shake. The motor is still running as good as it ever did. Other than some slight wear along the edges, the belt is in amazingly good shape. I can't speak to the customer service, as I haven't used it.

The treadmill itself weighs 120 lbs, add the box and packing material and you are looking at 130 lbs you have to move. You will need two strong people to move the box. If you must go up a stairway (heaven help you), maybe three people. I can see no physical way one person can move this box, put the unit together and then move the unit by themselves. You will need help, someone with muscles and mechanical skills for assembly.\nOur box arrived damaged, like someone used a box cutter and cut across the middle of the box. The only obvious damaged was one of the plastic âHandlebar Knobsâ with half the knob you turn broken off. Still usable.\nOne of the first things you need to decide is whether you will move the unopened box into the room where the treadmill will be located, or assemble the treadmill in say a garage, and then carry the folded treadmill (2 people) to the room. My wife and I messed up and took the box cover off and decided to move the open box to the room. So we needed to use rope around the opened box to hold the unit in the box, raised the box up on its long side, and using towels to protect the floor and ease of sliding, pushed and slid the box into the room where the treadmill was going to be located, about 50 feet from the garage on the same floor. Knowing what I know now, I would have assembled the unit in the garage and then we would have folded the unit as it can be folded, and then carried the folded unit to the room. Live and learn!\nAssembly: I would strongly recommend that the ProGear/Paradigm Health and Wellness people bring in customers who are unfamiliar with the unit and watch them follow the âassembly instructionsâ and the problems they encounter. The instructions were obviously written by someone who knows the unit, knows how it goes together. The company needs to bring in people totally unfamiliar with the unit, like two 70 year olds, show them the sealed box and watch what they do and the problems they have, never helping them, then rewrite the assembly instructions and add a few extra diagrams. Step 1 of the instructions is totally worthless. My wife and I, college educated, sat looking at the unit once it was out of the box and could not figure out how to execute the first part of Step 1, âPlace the treadmill in the upright positionâ as it does not show effectively how to expand the unit coming right out of the box. It took us almost an hour of looking and experimenting before we thought we knew what to do. And then a problem occurred with one of the spring-loaded knobs that was jammed in its hole, possibly another result of the damaged box. Step 1 is woefully inadequate to instruct a customer on how to expand the machine out of the box. We believe we have the unit assembled as required, but are not sure given the poor Step 1 instructions.\nSteps 2-4 were easy to follow, but the diagram in Step 3 is confusing. It shows that the console and the wires going into the base unit need to be connected. However, our consoleâs wires were already connected. One real challenge, the console sits loose in the box, connected to the base unit only by wires. As you are taking the unit out of the box and expanding it per Step 1, the console is dangling free and we were concerned the connections for the wires, not real robust, would break free. We taped the console to the back handlebar to avoid this, and then removed the tape when we started bolting the console to the console bracket.\nOperation and Quality: Once assembled, the unit presents a very strong and sturdy piece of exercise equipment comparable to units 2 or 3 times its cost. The unit began operating as expected, and my wife used it this morning for a full 30-minute walk and had no problems. It is very quiet. You could easily watch TV and walk without having the TV sound turned way up. We did notice that the safety tether is a little short if she walks in the middle of the treadmill. It could have another 6 inches to avoid being disconnected by accident. As a future enhancement, we would ask the manufacturer to add a stop switch on the right handlebar by the speed control. Reaching forward to hit the stop button on the console for people with short arms is a challenge.\nIf I ignore the assembly challenges, the quality and performance after 1 day are quite good for a $400+ walking treadmill. I would give this unit a rating of 5 stars, but I would give the very poor assembly instructions 1 star. But quality and performance outweigh the temporary assembly issues, the reason for the 4 star rating. Just remember, this is a two person job, moving the box, assembling the unit, and then moving the assembled unit to its final position."

     "name": "I have never used a treadmill before and didnât think I would. When I would see one at a friends home, it dominated the entire room. But when my husband came home from the hospital he needed to getting moving again so I started to search for a dreaded treadmill. I have been pleasantly surprised by this machine. It is sturdy yet not dominating. It was easy for me a 67 year old lady to assemble (not to easy to move as the box was large and heavy). The suggestion to use the packing materials to help set it up was genius. My husband is using the machine several times a day because I have it behind the sofa. It is shorter than the sofa so we can walk around it easily. I would recommend this model for anyone who needs to get up off the chair and get moving. Itâs safe and reliable."

    {
     "name": "The worse instruction's manuel for assembly I've ever come across. I think it was written by a 5th grader. I take that back, don't want to insult 5th graders, they could probably do a better job. The drawing illustrations are horrible and very difficult to understand, instructions are confusing and difficult to follow. There are two pieces needed for folding the thread mill, a safety tube and the air piston, and they're not even mentioned in the instructions and how to install them. Had to use common sense to figure it out. The thread mill comes practically unassembled with the exception of the handrails, everything else you have to put together, and with the horrible badly written instructions manuel it was difficult to put together. Good thing I have plenty of experience putting things together which helped me get through it. It's very heavy, and not easy to move around, even when folded for storage, it's still bulky and doesn't maneuver easily. If you're not experienced in putting things together, I wouldn't recommend you attempt this assembly on your own. You need strength, energy, common sense, and patients. The upside, once put together and running, it does operate smooth and very quite, the computer is easy to operate, and the controls button on the handrails to control speed, on/off switch and speed are a nice feature. And by holding the handrails with both hands over the pulse censor, keeps track of your heart rate. It was too bad, I had to have a bad experience with the horrible instructions manuel, and difficulty of putting it together before I could enjoy it."

     "name": "EDIT 2: I sent an email as directed by the company. I was supposed to get a reply in 3-4 days. After a week I paid to have this piece of junk hauled off because I don't have room to have something this large wasting space in my home. After OVER a week, they contact me, tell me if I ship it back they can refund me (most people aren't going to keep defective and useless products sitting indefinitely). I informed them I just had it shipped of to the dump, was told \"oh, nevermind, we assumed you'd keep up junk trashing up your home for a while, bye\". Yeah, so their customer support is as horrible as their products. Spend your money elsewhere.\nEDIT: Just to include a pic of the broken roller. Treadmill supposed to be rated for 400 lbs, yet 220 lbs caused that breakage so you can figure out yourself based on the weight you're at how much you'd trust it.\nWith light use, regular maintenance, died about 2 1/2 years in. Which is insanely low for a treadmill (our last one lasted 9 years). Would NOT recommend the brand.\nI've been on treadmills that were not motor driven that were more sturdily built. This one didn't even have the guide on it to keep the belt on track (probably what led to the insanely short time before it met an end), so you'd have to constantly adjust the belt one way or the other, even when you got it perfect, next time you use it it would go back off center again and need adjusted. Pathetic."

    {
     "name": "After about one year I've started having problems with a clacking noise from the back area of the treadmill. I thought maybe loosening the belt could help, but no way. It seems to get louder the faster this treadmill runs. I've gone to the website of my ProGear HCXL 4000 Treadmill where they have \"Live Assist\". After waiting 15 minutes it appeared no one was mining that area. Also, there does not seem to be a working forum where I can contact other users to see if any are having the same situation and what they do to eradicate the problem. The knocking noise sound serious to me. I'm just hoping the treadmill is not ready to be trashed. I am convinced there is no customer service assist. I have not been able to contact anyone from the company regarding my problem with this treadmill. Has anyone else had a problem with this product and was able to contact customer service? Before I purchased this product, I checked out many of the reviews here and then decided to buy. I am convinced buying a product such as this may not be the best choice. The only way to have repairs done is have someone come to our home since this item is too heavy to load in the SUV. We may have to end up calling our local Salvation Army to come pick this up as a donation. It only held up for one year and that's not good at all."

     "name": "UPDATE:\nI was contacted by the manufacturer's customer service, encouraging me to review the product. In exchange, they offered a floor mat or maintenance kit as a thank you. However, after posting the review they simply ghosted me, reneging on the offer. This feels like a pretty untrustworthy brand now, and I regret the purchase because I dread the day anything goes wrong with the treadmill. A company like this is most assuredly not going to stand by their products when push comes to shove.\nMoreover, and unrelated to the terrible customer service, they just pushed an update to their iFit software that FORCES a music player on during your workouts. There is literally no way to stop or remove it. The workaround at the moment seems to be setting the volume to zero and learning to live with the ugly media overlay they added. I cannot for the life of me understand why they'd wreck the experience like that. Why not add a close/remove function?\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI've very much enjoyed having my NordicTrack Commercial 2450. I use mine primarily for running, primarily in manual workout mode since I have my own training plan.\nIt was easy to assemble, but it's an incredibly heavy machine. This is good thing for its stability when training on it, but does make it a bit of a workout to assemble it. Definitely *do not* plan to do this by yourself. I did not hire external help to assemble it, which worked out fine (it's not necessary). However, if you don't have access to two fairly strong people, consider paying for assembly.\nThe reason I've given it 4 rather than 5 stars is that the technology is pretty rough around the edges. If you care deeply about the recorded or live workouts, you may find iFit to need work. You will especially feel this if you are coming from Peleton or equally polished experience. However, it basically works fine so I would not be scared away. Furthermore, at the moment you get a year of iFit for free, so you have ample time to figure out whether it's something you want to use.\nThe 14-inch screen is totally sufficient for me, especially because I don't use iFit all that often. However, if you *know* you love iFit and have the money, consider an upgrade to the 2950 for a much larger screen. If you don't care about the screen (e.g. you're sure you won't ever use iFit) the 1750 can save you a few hundred dollars. However, it also has a weaker motor, so it's not purely a screen downgrade."

     "name": "I have owned this treadmill since December 2019. It broke down in April of 2020, so I only used it for 4 months. With this treadmill, I bought the full service maitenance and warranty package. However, it took over 5 months to get it fixed. Then after I got it fixed, it malfunctioned again in early November. I had to contact them three times to get any kind of assistance. Finally, someone said they would order a replacement part. That was over a month ago. I have spent HOURS just on hold with these people only to get hung up on. I have emailed their customer service / help desk SEVEN times. I never received ONE reply or even a status on the part I am supposed to put in myself b/c they can'gt bother to even get someone to do it. Keep in mind, i have not once received one routine maitenance visit the entire time i had this warranty.\nThey have THE worst customer service. They blame it on COVID, but how does COVID really pfrevent you from people working from home to answer phones? It doesn't. It's a complete joke. They do not care about their customers. Their treadmills break down, and they do not care about fixing or replacing lemon treadmills.\nDo NOT buy anything from NordicTrack. Their customer service is completely absent. When you get a hold of someone, they are incredibly rude and callous. They never follow-up with you, and trying to get a hold of someone on the phone takes HOURS, & they usually get disconnected from you conveniently. It's disgusting and completely unacceptable.\nBUY A PELOTON!"

We worked with ifit support who quickly determined it should be replaced and submitted a parts replacement request for the entire console on 2 September. We have heard nothing since. When we called to check status 3 weeks later we were told, \"I don't know what to tell you, the part is on back order. Some people are having to wait others are not. I apologize that I cannot give you any information at this time. I suggest you send an email in a few weeks asking again.\" This was not a $30 purchase. NordicTrack clearly has an issue with this part or they wouldn't have so many requests and none available. Asked to talk to a manager, of course no one was available.

     "name": "Iâve had the treadmill 2450 for 2 weeks. The heart rate sensor grips are very inaccurate, reporting pulse of 45 to 188, jumping all over the place. Did all the recommended troubleshooting. Nordictrack refused to help, repeating that âthe heart rate grip sensors shouldnât be used as a medical device, only gives and average. We cannot improve accuracy. Please use a chest strap etc.â They were even rude to the point of threatening to close the chat if I didnât have any other issue without letting me finish. They did not want to hear the issue I am having with this brand new product. Really? This is an unacceptable response from the manufacturer. I feel that I got a preview of what is to come if the belt or other electrical components start acting up. Expect no support from Nordictrack. I had read about the poor customer service others have had from Nordictrack without truly believing it. Boy was I wrong! Absolute disappointment.\nEdit: Also beware of the good reviews. I just received an email from Nordictrack asking me for a good review in exchange for a free matt or maintenance kit. How about fixing my treadmill first?"

     "name": "The First one was damaged on delivery, but this one went together pretty quick (4.5hrs) and easily.\nI'd say the only thing that makes this non-Commercial, is the clicking sound it makes while running and\nthe belt slightly rubbing on something inside the motor housing. Hope it doesn't cause excessive wear. I've elected not to enter my Credit card to gain access to the iFit stuff but there are a few unlocked iFit programs available. Otherwise, this is a great piece of equipment.\nUpdate: Still love this product 6 months later, but would not buy again from Amazon. Six months later, billed me $2118.94 a second time. Their explanation we never scanned the second unit as being returned, even though Amazon sent the truck to pick it up. Didn't want to pay for interest charged to my credit card. Very bad customer service.... don't know how many times they did this so turning my account off."

     "name": "Seriously, for years I put off buying a treadmill for so many reasons I lost count, but the big ones were up-front cost, space, and my fear that I'd lose interest in it -- way safer to keep a gym membership with a treadmill there, but have other options too. Enter COVID. LOL\nI really tried to adapt and just run/walk/hike on my own, but boredom with this dragged on alongside COVID. I looked at used treadmills to save some $$$ but just wasn't finding anything that suited. My last straw was the free iFit trial I got on my phone, just to see how I liked the style/format---figured it'd be too corny for me and that I'd struggle with virtual training (having tried it before), but turns out I liked it more than I thought I would. Global workouts (some relief for the travel-deprived) + personalities + a huge range of workout options was really working for me.\nOVERVIEW\nHave had this thing a few days now and am freakin' in love with it. I doubt I'll lose interest...even if I cancel iFit after the year trial, the freedom and flexibility I've got with this thing to run/walk anytime I'm free without being hindered by weather, time of day, personal safety, is pretty liberating. I'm just mad it took me this long to get off the fence about getting one in the first place.\nMODEL CHOICE\nAs a lover of hiking, I looked seriously at NT's incline trainer, but between the primo price and the fact that the deck didn't raise, I dropped back to the Commercial 2450. I actually looked at ProForm too to save some dough since it's the same parent company as NT, but was won over by NT's larger screens and more solid consumer reviews (but would probably be just fine with a ProForm, honestly). Anyway, I don't regret not getting the incline trainer...having done the Waipio Valley hike with Johnnie Gale this morning, 15% incline is plenty...and if that's not burning your calves enough, jack up the speed, lol.\nFEATURES\nLots of feature-talk in other reviews so I'll try not to echo too much here...but one complaint by some is that some models were shipped by Amazon without a tray for setting up a tablet in case you want to watch TV or whatnot (since the screen on the trainer won't do that). Mine has the tray, so...wasn't a problem. Fan works fine as a nice cool breeze--thinking of dabbing some essential oil on a cotton ball and taping to the back so I can get some plumeria vibes on the Hawaii training series! LOL! Deck isn't too heavy/hard to raise, but be safe and lift with the legs. The tablet on the trainer has a tilt option, but it's not great, so if you're doing the non-treadmill workouts it can be tough to see. I'd recommend downloading iFit on your phone/tablet and connecting your account there. I haven't noticed any issues between having my account on the trainer and my iPhone. Have had no issues with power/program glitches/freezes/restarts. Fingers crossed it stays that way.\nOne part I'm still sorting out -- doing manual adjustments to speed/incline in iFit workouts. This is possible, but it does seem buggy sometimes. For example, I'll let the program control the incline, but I might want to adjust speed. If I adjust speed 5-6 times or so, the incline stops auto-adjusting, so I click \"follow the trainer\" mid-workout as a reset, and start my own adjustments over. This doesn't require stopping the program, and honestly, could be partly user-error. Either way, not a big deal.\nSHIPMENT\nLike many, I ordered through Amazon b/c the shipping was better than NT's site, where things were on backorder. Given some reviews, I was a little worried though, about damage during transit/delivery. I had zero issue with this, thankfully. I'm wondering if Amazon changed their shipping strategy to account for this b/c I did notice the date I picked for shipping when I ordered got pushed out a week by Amazon. As I tracked things on their site over the days, I noticed the shipment status was vague for over a week before it shipped, and the delivery date changed twice. No one actually contacted me personally via phone to confirm delivery timing/etc., so I contacted Amazon customer service via their chat function. Their agents had more info than what appeared on the site to me which helped. Once it shipped, the email updates came rolling in as to tracking/delivery status. Since they contract the delivery to another company, it wasn't clear at all how to change the delivery date if I had a conflict, but I'm sure if I contacted customer service again, that could get sorted. All told, I ordered the trainer July 31 with an Aug 5 delivery date, but got it on the 11th. If that was the price to pay for COVID and getting it without being damaged, I'll take it. ;)\nDELIVERY\nMaybe it's b/c I live in a single-story home, but the delivery driver took no issue bringing it across the threshold for me. He even helped me orient it so I had an easier time unboxing.\nASSEMBLY\nTo be clear, this really is a 2-person job. But I chose to assemble as much as I could solo, then get a friend to help with the rest. Wound up doing the whole thing myself, though I fully appreciate why this isn't the smartest idea, lol. Instructions were pretty clear to me, pieces were neatly organized, and this is one of the few things I've put together where I didn't screw up/misinterpret and have to go back several steps. Bulk aside, I've had worse issues with assembling Ikea shelves, so props to the NT folks on making this clear/easy. And kudos and thanks to those who posted tips in other reviews. Using the box as a sled for getting the deck oriented (I even kept part of the cardboard under the console half of the unit to protect my floor), and assembling in the spot you plan to use it is an absolute must, whether you're assembling yourself or not. This thing has wheels, but wheeling it down the hall to another spot in my home isn't happening. Forget the weight/bulk...based on the direction the wheels are oriented, this thing is too wide for my hallway. I could turn it 90 degrees, but then the wheels are useless so...yes, determine where you want it first, THEN build. Thinking ahead to a situation where you might move residences, one thing I'm considering is taking the entire upper frame off the unit so it can move in 2 pieces (deck + upper frame/console, b/c my main concern would be damaging walls/floors/the unit and especially the console itself). If you don't fully snap in the two plastic pieces that sit over the legs at the base (these plastic pieces are simply cosmetic, and not snapping them in makes zero difference to the look/functionality), you can raise them and access the bolts they cover to unscrew the frame/console...and this absolutely WILL take 2 people...just be sure you disconnect the wire connecting the console to the power supply on the back of the running deck, and safely secure it."

     "name": "First off - I love this treadmill. For a great price, you get a wide belt, attractive console, and a nice feature set. The treadmill runs quiet. Also, I didnât think that I would like or even use the iFit service, but itâs fabulous! I will likely continue my subscription past the free trial period.\nMy 2 star rating is because of my horrible experience buying this through Amazon. I Initially bought the treadmill in November as part of a Black Friday deal that included free assembly. Unfortunately, the first treadmill arrived broken - a plastic piece had broken off the hand rail during shipping. The assembly professional had set it up before the damage was realized. Several weeks later and numerous calls with Amazon customer service, the second one finally came. Every step of the way, there was confusion, miscommunication, and poor coordination between Amazon and the third party delivery services which took more phone calls and hours of my time. Then, once the machine was was finally assembled, there was an issue preventing iFit install. An error message kept saying that the treadmill was located out of the US (even though Iâm in Minnesota). More calls - first with iFit, then NordicTrack, then another long call with Amazon. Finally, I got it working myself by installing an update and initiating iFit with a different email account.\nIt is February, over two months after I ordered the treadmill, and now I can finally enjoy my it. While I received a âgood dealâ from Amazon, it took 8 phone calls with Amazon, coordination with 3 different delivery companies, 2 assembly techs, and 4 missed days of work to be home during the deliveries and pickups. After all of that, I wish I had bought it for full price directly through NordicTrack."

Weeks went by with communication! When we followed up they said the part was on back order with no idea when it would be sent! We have contacted multiple times with no resolution! The last call we were told they would send us an email about it. Never received anything! We continue to use the machine and when there are no issues we love it! When issues arise it is not as good. We love the ifit that we have with the unit. We also purchased the warranty plan with the equipment purchase. Would like to get the issue resolved. Without the technical problems the rating would have been higher! Lower rating has to do with lack of the company to solve the technical issue. The company does not stand behind their product!!!!"

     "name": "Got the 2450 in September. Read many reviews, both written and YouTube reviews. Pretty much all ranked NordicTrak the best. Yes, some people have had issues, and many said customer service is very slow. I rolled the dice anyway and bought it.\nIt took about 30 minutes to get everything out of the box, which was very heavy. It was packed well, with a lot of padding. Be warned, you will have a massive amount of cardboard, styrofoam and wood support pieces to discard. It took me about 3 hours to put it together myself, for the most part. Iâve heard itâs supposed to only take an hour, but it took me 3, for whatever reason. Turned it on, it immediately recognized my wife, and did a software update. Did a test run, and it worked great as advertised.\nA few minor gripes, as some others have mentioned. Everything, other than the 2 metal stands that support the console, is plastic. Obviously, plastic can crack if you are not careful. The toe plate absolutely should be metal. Occasionally, my toes slightly hit it. It wouldnât take much to crack that. The console had a slight manufacturing mold defect. The vents that the fan blows air through have some visible defects. Not big enough for me to demand a new console, as you can barely see it, but for $2300, one expects perfection.\nThe screen is nice, but the operating system is slow...probably Android, but I have no idea. It takes about 1 minute after you turn it on for it to load. IFit is very cool. Dozens of different runs to choose from, from all over the world. Maybe over 100...not sure. They seem to add new ones all the time. You can choose a running one, and just set your speed as you want. You do not have to do the automated speed and inclines. As others have said, the image quality is good, but it buffers at the beginning. It seems to be HD, 1080 maybe, or possibly just 720, but either way, it is certainly compressed. FYI, the 2450 has a 14â screen....pretty decent size. The 1750 only has a 10â screen, which to me is too small for iFit. The 2950 has a huge 22â screen, but itâs an extra $700. And they do have a $4000 treadmill that comes with a monster 32â screen. But as close as you are to it, itâs just too much.\nI got a free year of iFit with the purchase. After that, it is $39/mo. Is it worth that much? Not to me. Maybe $15/mo. We got this mainly for the winter months. The other 8 months, we wonât use it much, unless itâs raining outside. You do not need to have iFit to use the treadmill. You can just set the speed and incline/decline. The screen is pretty basic on the manual setting like this. Just a white screen, with an oval shape, plus your speed and a few details. It definitely could be spruced up a bit.\nThe power cord is at the front right, as is the power button. The way we have ours right up against a wall to the front and the right, it is awkward to plug in and turn on. I just donât want it plugged in unless I am using it...no biggie.\nOverall, very happy. Itâs a solid treadmill that does everything as advertised. Zero issues so far, but will cross my fingers. I realize any problems could take a while to resolve. Parts and service calls right now are very slow, from what I hear. Hopefully, I donât have to deal with that for a few years."

     "name": "First of all, I expected a little more. Maybe I am used to the quality of my Peloton bike, but when I finally got the treadmill put together, it felt like it belonged in the workout room of a Fairfield Inn, rather than the Ritz Carlton equipment I am used to. And the price isn't that much different. The NordicTrack is definitely plasticky and fit is not reflective of a $2500 treadmill.\nGot this for my wife for her birthday, and she was underwhelmed as well. She had researched treadmills and thought that this was the ideal one for her, only to find that most basic features are not there. The NT advertises BT compatibility, but it is only one way. You can only play your music through their speakers, not play your workout through headphones. Not great for when we try to do side-by-side workouts together. Also, we expected the iFit to be more like the Peloton classes, having an option for a good, encouraging, MUSIC FILLED workout. The iFit is pretty cheesy with an athelete giving a tour and background of an area. This does not motivate me to work harder at all. We are looking at putting a tablet on top of the screen and running the Peloton running workouts instead.\nA lot of people really seem to like this treadmill, but as I said, it definitely falls short of what we were expecting"

     "name": "I'm an avid runner and average around 40-50 mpw. I ordered this treadmill about 10 months ago. I used it 5 day a week during the winter months in MN. The first problem I have encountered (after about 3 months) is the screen over the speakers started rusting, and is now heavily rusted and looks terrible. The shut off key also is rusting. I do sweat but not profusely, and i also wipe it down every time i use it with a dry towel, i keep it inside in a dry environment. The next problem after about 8 months it starts abruptly and stops and will not start again. I've now contacted costumer service and will see how that goes.\nI do not recommend this treadmill or any treadmill from Nordic track. I think this product is for some one who wants a great looking machine to just sit in the corner and not be used much.\nUpdate. I called costumer service (this took over 1 1/2 hours on the phone) and they will not cover/replace the rusted screen over the speakers. I also had contact a technician over email help me figure out what was wrong but after a few emails stopped responding to me. This metal screen is defective since it is not painted on both sides and will rust if you get sweat on it. Maybe mine was just missed when it was manufactured but I really doubt it. Costumer service said you need to wipe it down with a soapy towel and a dry towel every time you use it (per the owners manual), which will also cause it to rust since you cant wipe the inside of the screen. SO it is defective and will rust and they will not cover it in the warranty and Nordic Track knows this since they have put these instructions in the owners manual. The main frame tubes are also not painted on the inside and are also rusting. I'll get back and see if they will replace the controller which after talking to the Nordic Track Tec is the other problem, it started to sound like they may not send a replacement even though it is covered by the 12 month warranty They will also not replace the rusty key. This is a cheaply made treadmill and is not worth your $$"

And if you donât want to pay the fee, you literally have one option...an oval track. On top of that, my drive motor began acting up and intermittently starting and stopping. Luckily I am still within the warranty period, but I probably have 100 miles or less. Should not happen on a âcommercialâ treadmill."

It is now 7 1/2 months old.\nIf you do not use/register with Ifit (monthly charge), you may not be able to use the treadmill unless you disconnect wifi and restore the unit to original settings after some software upgrades. Contacted tech support and after a week, they requested my address and serial number (that is already registered with them) then they closed the ticket. Unit still is not able to log on with wifi connected.\nNow the drive motor is squeaking loudly. Sent another service request to iconfitness to request service. Found black plastic dust in the bottom of the unit, under the motor. Could not find where it was coming from.\nThe device name is Commercial 2450. I think the Commercial just means that they advertise it. It is nowhere near commercial quality. Plastic is used to support the lift mechanism.\nI won't buy another NordicTrack product. Sad to see such product quality decline."

     "name": "We used Amazon Services to assemble, which I thought was completely worth it. The guy who came was professional and set it up in 45 minutes. I asked if he had set up this model before and he said he'd set up at least 25 of this model alone recently.\nThis NordicTrack is perfect for me. Note, that the programming (iFit) has hikes and the treadmill will try to match with the actual experience. So, if you want to feel the steepest of inclines then you may want a treadmill that can do steeper inclines. 15 is good for me. I am VERY glad I got the decline. It's worth the money and sometimes when you jog, its nice to have it be easier without stopping to walk. Something about what it does for you mentally is worth the money. The treadmill is easy to fold and unfold but my 12 year old cant figure it out. Also, you have to be an adult size to really get it down, so it is very child/toddler safe.\nFinally, ifit. It comes free, so its easy to ignore what this even is. Without ifit, you get some basic programming and a manual workout that shows a track and your progress around it. iFIT brings this treadmill to life. This is the family plan that comes free, so you can have 5 profiles and it stores your history. The programming is vast and has both live and pre-recorded workouts. Some of the trainers are completely amazing. The workouts span from a walk through pyramids to a jog in Switzerland to training for competitive running.\nI highly recommend this product. I only marked a 4 for maneuverability because we havent tried to move it. But it does have wheels and looks manageable."

     "name": "I purchased this treadmill in March 2020 and it arrived a few weeks later. It was not too difficult to assemble but some of the steps required two people to complete. I also found some of the bolt holes did not line up perfectly which made them difficult to screw in.\nRunning on the treadmill is great, the deck, even with the softer setting, still seems a bit hard at first but it seems to be getting more cushion the more it is used. If you like a more firmer running surface, the firm setting is very firm.\nI was excited about the Ifit functionality, but I've only used it a couple of times and usually run on the manual setting. I do like the fact that each user can have a separate login, so each person can track their own statistics. The screen is large and offers different views depending on how you like to see the details of your run. The quick setting buttons on the side of the console make it easy to change speed and incline, the same buttons on the touch screen are almost impossible to use when running.\nThe reasons I only rated this treadmill 3 stars: After only 4 months, the lower console buttons stopped working. These consist of the fan, volume, start, stop, speed and incline controls. In addition rust was starting to show up on the front grill that covers the speakers and the two front support posts were being discolored by sweat despite the machine being wiped down after each run. To figure out why the lower console was not working, I unassembled the console section and discovered the ribbon cable going to this area had been discolored and the wires in the cable were damaged.\nI reached out to Nordic Track support mid August and began a very slow back and forth email exchange, usually 5 days to a week between their responses. After asking for pictures they agreed to send a replacement console, however a week later it still is showing in progress and has not shipped. It is disappointing that it has taken over 3 weeks and I still have not had a resolution to this problem.\nI feel that for a piece of exercise equipment that is wiped down and cleaned after every use, sweat should not affect it so easily. The grill that coverts the speakers can be wiped off, but any sweat that gets into the grill is impossible to clean, just like any sweat that gets into the fan grills is impossible to clean. Support informed me that any visible rust will automatically disqualify a warranty repair/replacement, but they made an exception this time.\nI'm glad I purchased the three year warranty as I feel that it will come in handy if the treadmill continues to be affected by sweat caused by using the treadmill.\nUPDATE: According to Nordic Track customer support, the console is back ordered and there is no estimate as to when it will ship. This is disappointing and frustrating.\nUpdate2: over one month later and I still have not received the replacement console. No updates from Nordic Track and no ETA on when part will ship. Lowered my star rating to 2 Stars due to this ongoing problem.\nUpdate 3: Finally got the replacement console, after waiting almost 4 months for the replacement. In order to remove the old console and replace it with a new console, you have to dismantle the majority of the upper part of the treadmill.\nThis treadmill is affected by sweat. Both support posts get stained from sweat, and the grill on the speakers and emergency stop key get rusty from sweat, even when wiped down after each use. I believe the original console stopped working because of sweat getting inside and shorting a wire. I have taken some precautions to reduce the possibility of sweat getting into the console and also rusting the speaker grill, since rust will void the warranty."

     "name": "Definitely would not recommend this product to anyone. Had to return the first unit as it showed up with the plastic front lower cover broken as the box had obviously been dropped. The front lower cover was cheap thin plastic and the treadmill weighs 340lbs in the box, so it was not surprising it broke when the box was dropped in transit. That was just poor engineering, imho.\nThe replacement treadmill showed up in better shape, although it was clear the box had also been dropped and was torn up, but other than a small dent nothing appeared broken. We assembled the treadmill and ran into the following problems:\n1. Four of the screws for securing the handles to the metal bars would not screw into the pre-drilled holes . I had to get a tap and rethread the screw holes. Same was true of two screws on the top of the upright pillars. That was a needless problem but fixable. But a lot of folks might not know how to rethread the holes.\n2. The instructions for booting up the system were very poor. Basically just says to follow the instructions on the screen. Halfway through the setup dialog the system got lost and we ended up having to configure the system by working through the settings rather than using the supposed setup dialog. Could not find any way to restart the setup dialog.\n3. The instructions recommended going through the \"console tour\" to learn how to use the console. As far as we could tell there was no way to access the console tour. It was supposed to show up as part of the setup process but that quit halfway through. We found the software for the unit to be very poor quality in general.\n4. The system boots up very very slowly and has a slow response time in general. This is made worse by the fact that you are supposed to log off, turn off the power switch, and then, I kid you not, unplug the treadmill from the wall outlet every time you are done using it. Apparently if you leave the unit plugged in it degrades the electronics, even though they insist you use a surge suppressor. So every time you use the treadmill you have to wait out the long boot up time.\n5. When you are jogging on the treadmill and want to get close enough to make changes to speed or incline you will find your feet hitting the bezel on the front of the treadmill. I found myself stumbling when my foot hit the bezel which is a bit dangerous when jogging fast. Very annoying.\n6. After we used the unit 5 times the elevation calibration quit working. Called support and sat on hold for an hour and gave up. The iFit and NordicTrack website support was completely useless except that we were finally able to get someone to respond on online chat. They told us either the electronics board or the elevation motor was broken and to call support to get it repaired. Useless as support won't answer the phone.\n7. The documentation and user interface were very confusing in terms of differentiating between the basic NordicTrack software and operations vs iFit software and operations. It was also difficult to figure out how to use the iFit software as the user interface was poorly designed and hard to navigate. There were also several software bugs that periodically showed up which compounded the problems.\n8. The main reason we chose this unit was the supposed benefits of iFit and the supposed high end treadmill quality. But the iFit software seemed to be largely just a collection of workout videos. There did not appear to be any guidance as to how best to utilize the workout videos to improve your fitness. For the videos we used the narrative in the video was largely the fitness instructor repeating that they were speeding up or down which was pretty useless. In my opinion it would have been better for the instructor to also comment on the area they were walking through and how best to use the videos.\n9. On the workout videos we used if you choose to speed up the pace from the default set for the video you have to manually adjust it as the video proceeds rather than the software just adjusting up the speed or incline for you. That was really annoying and a very poor user interface.\n10. Basically the software is crap and the support won't answer the phone and the incline electronics were broken and we had had enough and returned the unit.\nOne last important note. I went to 3 different treadmill review sites and this unit was highly rated on all three. Unfortunately I did not read the negative reviews on Amazon or Consumer Reports. Big mistake as there are some very negative reviews mentioning several of the problems we ran into. It turns out some review sites are fake and have bogus reviews. Leaves me wondering if I got hustled."

     "name": "Prior to the pandemic I went to the gym several times week. Although i was able to walk and run outside during the spring and summer, it's not as convenient (or appealing) with the weather change and shorter daylight hours. Additionally, in August/ September, working out outside wasn't really an option with the bad air qualify we had in our area due to various ongoing fires. i had been considering a treadmill for a few months and kept coming back to the NordicTrack 2450. Had the features I wanted for a reasonable price.\nAssembly - Definitely helpful to have another person to help you. Assembly went pretty smoothly with the exception of lining up the pulse bar when attaching the console. Took a few attempts but everything fit together well. Guessing it took two people a total of approximately 2-3 hours to assemble.\nTreadmill - The treadmill feels solid. One feature I definitely wanted was the one-touch incline and speed controls. They are definitely convenient to have. I also like the fact you can adjust the firmness of the deck. (Set mine of softer setting.) The treadmill gets up to speed quickly. Incline adjustments are slower, but can't say it's any slower than most other treadmills I've used. I was able to easily synch my (Orange Theory) heart rate monitor to the treadmill. It's connected each time without any issues. Shortly after I purchased the treadmill, there was a software update that rolled out that allowed me to synch my AirPods too! On average I've been using the treadmill about 4-5x a week.\niFit -I started with a 6 week intro to running series. Great to get me used to running on a treadmill again after having not been on one in over 6 months. The video/ instructor help the workout time pass by pretty quickly. The search/ filter feature on iFit could be a bit better. With all of the various workouts available, it can be a bit daunting to find one that fits your needs/ wants.\nSince I was a regular gym goer for 30+ years before purchasing the treadmill, I anticipate the treadmill will continue to get regular use. Working out at home has been super convenient, so at this point I'm not in a rush to return to the gym once they fully reopen. I will likely purchase the service/ protection plan so I can get the treadmill serviced regularly."

     "name": "UPDATE:\nI was contacted by the manufacturer's customer service, encouraging me to review the product. In exchange, they offered a floor mat or maintenance kit as a thank you. However, after posting the review they simply ghosted me, reneging on the offer. This feels like a pretty untrustworthy brand now, and I regret the purchase because I dread the day anything goes wrong with the treadmill. A company like this is most assuredly not going to stand by their products when push comes to shove.\nMoreover, and unrelated to the terrible customer service, they just pushed an update to their iFit software that FORCES a music player on during your workouts. There is literally no way to stop or remove it. The workaround at the moment seems to be setting the volume to zero and learning to live with the ugly media overlay they added. I cannot for the life of me understand why they'd wreck the experience like that. Why not add a close/remove function?\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI've very much enjoyed having my NordicTrack Commercial 2450. I use mine primarily for running, primarily in manual workout mode since I have my own training plan.\nIt was easy to assemble, but it's an incredibly heavy machine. This is good thing for its stability when training on it, but does make it a bit of a workout to assemble it. Definitely *do not* plan to do this by yourself. I did not hire external help to assemble it, which worked out fine (it's not necessary). However, if you don't have access to two fairly strong people, consider paying for assembly.\nThe reason I've given it 4 rather than 5 stars is that the technology is pretty rough around the edges. If you care deeply about the recorded or live workouts, you may find iFit to need work. You will especially feel this if you are coming from Peleton or equally polished experience. However, it basically works fine so I would not be scared away. Furthermore, at the moment you get a year of iFit for free, so you have ample time to figure out whether it's something you want to use.\nThe 14-inch screen is totally sufficient for me, especially because I don't use iFit all that often. However, if you *know* you love iFit and have the money, consider an upgrade to the 2950 for a much larger screen. If you don't care about the screen (e.g. you're sure you won't ever use iFit) the 1750 can save you a few hundred dollars. However, it also has a weaker motor, so it's not purely a screen downgrade."

With this treadmill, I bought the full service maitenance and warranty package. However, it took over 5 months to get it fixed. Then after I got it fixed, it malfunctioned again in early November. I had to contact them three times to get any kind of assistance. Finally, someone said they would order a replacement part. That was over a month ago. I have spent HOURS just on hold with these people only to get hung up on. I have emailed their customer service / help desk SEVEN times.

They blame it on COVID, but how does COVID really pfrevent you from people working from home to answer phones? It doesn't. It's a complete joke. They do not care about their customers. Their treadmills break down, and they do not care about fixing or replacing lemon treadmills.\nDo NOT buy anything from NordicTrack. Their customer service is completely absent.

Global workouts (some relief for the travel-deprived) + personalities + a huge range of workout options was really working for me.\nOVERVIEW\nHave had this thing a few days now and am freakin' in love with it. I doubt I'll lose interest...even if I cancel iFit after the year trial, the freedom and flexibility I've got with this thing to run/walk anytime I'm free without being hindered by weather, time of day, personal safety, is pretty liberating. I'm just mad it took me this long to get off the fence about getting one in the first place.\nMODEL CHOICE\nAs a lover of hiking, I looked seriously at NT's incline trainer, but between the primo price and the fact that the deck didn't raise, I dropped back to the Commercial 2450. I actually looked at ProForm too to save some dough since it's the same parent company as NT, but was won over by NT's larger screens and more solid consumer reviews (but would probably be just fine with a ProForm, honestly). Anyway, I don't regret not getting the incline trainer...having done the Waipio Valley hike with Johnnie Gale this morning, 15% incline is plenty...and if that's not burning your calves enough, jack up the speed, lol.\nFEATURES\nLots of feature-talk in other reviews so I'll try not to echo too much here...but one complaint by some is that some models were shipped by Amazon without a tray for setting up a tablet in case you want to watch TV or whatnot (since the screen on the trainer won't do that). Mine has the tray, so...wasn't a problem. Fan works fine as a nice cool breeze--thinking of dabbing some essential oil on a cotton ball and taping to the back so I can get some plumeria vibes on the Hawaii training series! LOL! Deck isn't too heavy/hard to raise, but be safe and lift with the legs. The tablet on the trainer has a tilt option, but it's not great, so if you're doing the non-treadmill workouts it can be tough to see. I'd recommend downloading iFit on your phone/tablet and connecting your account there. I haven't noticed any issues between having my account on the trainer and my iPhone. Have had no issues with power/program glitches/freezes/restarts. Fingers crossed it stays that way.\nOne part I'm still sorting out -- doing manual adjustments to speed/incline in iFit workouts. This is possible, but it does seem buggy sometimes. For example, I'll let the program control the incline, but I might want to adjust speed. If I adjust speed 5-6 times or so, the incline stops auto-adjusting, so I click \"follow the trainer\" mid-workout as a reset, and start my own adjustments over. This doesn't require stopping the program, and honestly, could be partly user-error. Either way, not a big deal.\nSHIPMENT\nLike many, I ordered through Amazon b/c the shipping was better than NT's site, where things were on backorder. Given some reviews, I was a little worried though, about damage during transit/delivery. I had zero issue with this, thankfully. I'm wondering if Amazon changed their shipping strategy to account for this b/c I did notice the date I picked for shipping when I ordered got pushed out a week by Amazon. As I tracked things on their site over the days, I noticed the shipment status was vague for over a week before it shipped, and the delivery date changed twice. No one actually contacted me personally via phone to confirm delivery timing/etc., so I contacted Amazon customer service via their chat function. Their agents had more info than what appeared on the site to me which helped. Once it shipped, the email updates came rolling in as to tracking/delivery status. Since they contract the delivery to another company, it wasn't clear at all how to change the delivery date if I had a conflict, but I'm sure if I contacted customer service again, that could get sorted. All told, I ordered the trainer July 31 with an Aug 5 delivery date, but got it on the 11th. If that was the price to pay for COVID and getting it without being damaged, I'll take it. ;)\nDELIVERY\nMaybe it's b/c I live in a single-story home, but the delivery driver took no issue bringing it across the threshold for me. He even helped me orient it so I had an easier time unboxing.\nASSEMBLY\nTo be clear, this really is a 2-person job. But I chose to assemble as much as I could solo, then get a friend to help with the rest. Wound up doing the whole thing myself, though I fully appreciate why this isn't the smartest idea, lol. Instructions were pretty clear to me, pieces were neatly organized, and this is one of the few things I've put together where I didn't screw up/misinterpret and have to go back several steps. Bulk aside, I've had worse issues with assembling Ikea shelves, so props to the NT folks on making this clear/easy. And kudos and thanks to those who posted tips in other reviews. Using the box as a sled for getting the deck oriented (I even kept part of the cardboard under the console half of the unit to protect my floor), and assembling in the spot you plan to use it is an absolute must, whether you're assembling yourself or not. This thing has wheels, but wheeling it down the hall to another spot in my home isn't happening. Forget the weight/bulk...based on the direction the wheels are oriented, this thing is too wide for my hallway. I could turn it 90 degrees, but then the wheels are useless so...yes, determine where you want it first, THEN build. Thinking ahead to a situation where you might move residences, one thing I'm considering is taking the entire upper frame off the unit so it can move in 2 pieces (deck + upper frame/console, b/c my main concern would be damaging walls/floors/the unit and especially the console itself). If you don't fully snap in the two plastic pieces that sit over the legs at the base (these plastic pieces are simply cosmetic, and not snapping them in makes zero difference to the look/functionality), you can raise them and access the bolts they cover to unscrew the frame/console...and this absolutely WILL take 2 people...just be sure you disconnect the wire connecting the console to the power supply on the back of the running deck, and safely secure it."

     "name": "First off - I love this treadmill. For a great price, you get a wide belt, attractive console, and a nice feature set. The treadmill runs quiet. Also, I didnât think that I would like or even use the iFit service, but itâs fabulous! I will likely continue my subscription past the free trial period.\nMy 2 star rating is because of my horrible experience buying this through Amazon. I Initially bought the treadmill in November as part of a Black Friday deal that included free assembly. Unfortunately, the first treadmill arrived broken - a plastic piece had broken off the hand rail during shipping. The assembly professional had set it up before the damage was realized. Several weeks later and numerous calls with Amazon customer service, the second one finally came. Every step of the way, there was confusion, miscommunication, and poor coordination between Amazon and the third party delivery services which took more phone calls and hours of my time. Then, once the machine was was finally assembled, there was an issue preventing iFit install. An error message kept saying that the treadmill was located out of the US (even though Iâm in Minnesota). More calls - first with iFit, then NordicTrack, then another long call with Amazon. Finally, I got it working myself by installing an update and initiating iFit with a different email account.\nIt is February, over two months after I ordered the treadmill, and now I can finally enjoy my it. While I received a âgood dealâ from Amazon, it took 8 phone calls with Amazon, coordination with 3 different delivery companies, 2 assembly techs, and 4 missed days of work to be home during the deliveries and pickups. After all of that, I wish I had bought it for full price directly through NordicTrack."

Weeks went by with communication! When we followed up they said the part was on back order with no idea when it would be sent! We have contacted multiple times with no resolution! The last call we were told they would send us an email about it. Never received anything! We continue to use the machine and when there are no issues we love it! When issues arise it is not as good. We love the ifit that we have with the unit. We also purchased the warranty plan with the equipment purchase. Would like to get the issue resolved. Without the technical problems the rating would have been higher! Lower rating has to do with lack of the company to solve the technical issue. The company does not stand behind their product!!!!"

     "name": "Got the 2450 in September. Read many reviews, both written and YouTube reviews. Pretty much all ranked NordicTrak the best. Yes, some people have had issues, and many said customer service is very slow. I rolled the dice anyway and bought it.\nIt took about 30 minutes to get everything out of the box, which was very heavy. It was packed well, with a lot of padding. Be warned, you will have a massive amount of cardboard, styrofoam and wood support pieces to discard. It took me about 3 hours to put it together myself, for the most part. Iâve heard itâs supposed to only take an hour, but it took me 3, for whatever reason. Turned it on, it immediately recognized my wife, and did a software update. Did a test run, and it worked great as advertised.\nA few minor gripes, as some others have mentioned. Everything, other than the 2 metal stands that support the console, is plastic. Obviously, plastic can crack if you are not careful. The toe plate absolutely should be metal. Occasionally, my toes slightly hit it. It wouldnât take much to crack that. The console had a slight manufacturing mold defect. The vents that the fan blows air through have some visible defects. Not big enough for me to demand a new console, as you can barely see it, but for $2300, one expects perfection.\nThe screen is nice, but the operating system is slow...probably Android, but I have no idea. It takes about 1 minute after you turn it on for it to load. IFit is very cool. Dozens of different runs to choose from, from all over the world. Maybe over 100...not sure. They seem to add new ones all the time. You can choose a running one, and just set your speed as you want. You do not have to do the automated speed and inclines. As others have said, the image quality is good, but it buffers at the beginning. It seems to be HD, 1080 maybe, or possibly just 720, but either way, it is certainly compressed. FYI, the 2450 has a 14â screen....pretty decent size. The 1750 only has a 10â screen, which to me is too small for iFit. The 2950 has a huge 22â screen, but itâs an extra $700. And they do have a $4000 treadmill that comes with a monster 32â screen. But as close as you are to it, itâs just too much.\nI got a free year of iFit with the purchase. After that, it is $39/mo. Is it worth that much? Not to me. Maybe $15/mo. We got this mainly for the winter months. The other 8 months, we wonât use it much, unless itâs raining outside. You do not need to have iFit to use the treadmill. You can just set the speed and incline/decline. The screen is pretty basic on the manual setting like this. Just a white screen, with an oval shape, plus your speed and a few details. It definitely could be spruced up a bit.\nThe power cord is at the front right, as is the power button. The way we have ours right up against a wall to the front and the right, it is awkward to plug in and turn on. I just donât want it plugged in unless I am using it...no biggie.\nOverall, very happy. Itâs a solid treadmill that does everything as advertised. Zero issues so far, but will cross my fingers. I realize any problems could take a while to resolve. Parts and service calls right now are very slow, from what I hear. Hopefully, I donât have to deal with that for a few years."

     "name": "I bought the NordicTrack 2450 Commercial in August 2020. The treadmill was working well until two weeks ago when it suddenly stopped working. After two days of trying to reach someone in Icon Fitness Customer Service Department to help me, I managed to get through. They asked me to send a video explaining the problem. The Customer Service Rep determined that the motor is broken and put in a order to replace it. Two weeks later I'm still waiting for the motor to arrive. When I try to check the order status on the Icon Fitness website I get no information on my order. Now I have a huge heavy $2500 piece of junk in my house. Terrible experience!"

     "name": "I love my Nordic Track, I love the fact that it has a big tablet mounted on, my only pet peeve is, I want to be able to use it as a tablet, so that I can watch a movie when I'm working out, I want to use it as a tablet so that I can read a book on Kindle, I want to be able to use my iphone to control the speed and the incline, I own a different treadmill that is smaller in size but it does have remote access through an app on my phone.\nThe workouts Nordic Track has are wonderful, the manual mode is what I use, still, I wish I could just place a laptop over the top of the Nordic Track screen, only, I can't do that because how do I know what my progress is, my laps, my heart rate, my calories, the time i am spending on it. It is way too big for my bedroom and it looks gigantic in my living room, if you have a ceiling fan in the middle of the living room like me, don't even try to stretch out while on the Nordic Track 2450, you will hit that ceiling fan really fast. It is tall, it is heavy, the box, the Styrofoam, the 4x4s that the treadmill comes packed in are going to cost you to have the Waste management company remove them, it didn't cost me because it happened to be during a citywide clean-up and it was free, but someone mentioned that where they live, it costs money to get rid of the waste. Also, it is difficult to assemble the treadmill by yourself, you need to have someone help you but when you are a loner like me, you are going to get pretty inventive, because the hydraulic arm that holds the platform up does not come fully assembled. I purchased a different treadmill before I purchased my Nordic Track and it almost came ready to use, two steps and I was done, not with Nordic Track, but that's why they are a renowned company that doesn't make junk. Thank you Nordic Track."

     "name": "I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it.\nI didn't intend to use the iFit video training stuff much. Turns out that is one of my favorite things about the treadmill. There is some gorgeous scenery and the different trainers enhance my desire to train longer or more frequently. I am more motivated because of the iFit system. There are \"videos\" of different places that one can watch while running without a trainer. Unfortunately those, instead of being actual videos, are multiple still photographs that lurch forward. Disappointed in them.\nIt is fairly quiet, all things considered. With the preset buttons for different speeds and inclines it is easy to switch back and forth during intervals. The fan is very powerful. That will be handy when it's warm. In the winter when I would get slightly sweaty, the fan was sometimes too powerful. Wish it had more gradations in adjustment.\nI don't run outside much any more - it hurts my knees sometimes, and my lower back almost always. (Abdominal obesity induced lumbar lordosis). Running on the treadmill, with the suspension system turned on, has not caused me ANY joint pains. I try to run at a 3% incline usually as I've read that further decreases joint impact.\nI had trouble getting my Polar H10 hr sensor to sync. It turned out the H10 can only sync with 1 thing at a time BUT if you use the Polar Beat app you can go into hr sensor settings and turn on the option of syncing two things with the HR sensor.\nI put it on carpet after studying all the mat and foam options. The front of the machine's weight is well distributed across the frame work, not just the wheels. The rear did begin to indent the carpet. I went to Lowes and bought some sheet metal type stuff that doesn't bend and yet is thin and put them under the rear legs. The metal was from the section of metal used to mesh or tie together wood. Because it's thin the metal doesn't affect the accuracy of the incline.\nGreat machine, a solid part of my fitness program, regardless of the weather!"

There are so many options to choose from and I love that the treadmill automatically adjusts as you complete a workout.\nAs far as the actual treadmill goes, it was fairly easy to assemble but very heavy so we needed some extra muscle to carry the boxes upstairs. Once assembled, setup was also pretty easy and I was able to jump on and try it out very quickly.\nI love the steep incline and also the option to decline. The motion is smooth and comfortable. The fans are a nice feature and very much welcomed when the workouts get intense! Controls are easy to use and adjust. The screen is a perfect size.I have no complaints. This machine has given me the extra push to get up and exercise and the IFit options keep me coming back each day for something new,"

     "name": "So I purchased this product in September of 2020, like most of you our Gym was closed so I was looking for a high quality product that I could use on a regular basis. Everything seemed good at first, the tread arrived on time and was easy enough to assemble but unfortunately the last three weeks have been a nightmare. I really enjoy the streaming videos but starting about 3 weeks ago my tablet started buffering and became unusable.\nI've tried everything that I can think of including reconfiguring my wireless network, resetting the tablet to factory settings etc. Nothing has worked. The customer support at Nordictrack is useless. They are yet to reach out to me proactively and they continue to blame my network. Mind you I'm running Gig Internet and I'm streaming all over the house with zero issues. I've had two of the reps I've spoken with admin that they are tired, overworked and short staffed. Here's the best part. I bought a Peloton bike around the same time and it's literally sitting next to my tread and it never ever buffers. Same type of tablet and it's running three times the speed that the tread tablet is running at.\nIt's obviously a problem that the Nordictrack reps don't want to have to deal with so today I'm returning this thing and buying a Peloton tread. After all, I've been running the Peloton tread workouts on the TV in my garage for the last three weeks (off of my Wifes bike account through a Roku stick) and they are fantastic. And they never buffer by the way."

     "name": "I'm a very active runner who was skeptical about how sturdy a $2K treadmill would be. But, when this summer's fires made air quality abysmal, I but the bullet and purchased the 2450. I was even further skeptical that Nordicktrack calls the units 'commercial 2450', because I know true commercial treadmills cost much more. In addition, this model is 40ish pounds lighter than other treadmills in its price class. But...I have been very pleasantly surprised. 1) This holds up absolutely fine not only for normal daily runs but also for mile/half-mile repeats ~10-11mph, 2) Assembly was much easier than I expected. Instructions are actually easy to follow (shocking I know) and I was able to assemble it on my own despite the note that 2 people are required. My daughter gave me a couple 2-min assists when having another hand was useful. 3) While I have no complaints about the ifit stuff, I generally prefer to craft my own workouts. And, the statistics layout (including vertical gain) is really good. This was probably the main reason I went for Nordicktrack over Peloton. They both have programmed/studio workouts but I am old school and picked what I thought was better for feeding my data needs when running without those programs. I am not disappointed. 4) The frills are pretty good....speaker quality, fan, console layout. My only concern was the package in which the treadmill was delivered was seriously messed-up...torn and taped back together. I'd read that in other reviews as well, and that fed some of my initial skepticism. Fortunately, nothing was damaged so it was a non-issue. I would caution that the package is also seriously heavy (despite being lighter than some other treadmills). It's only one box for ~300lbs. Plan on having family and friends available, especially if you decide you want this to go up a flight of stairs before you assemble. But, all in all...I am quite happy with this purchase."

I even purchased an extended warranty with annual visits that is unlikely to be used given how impossible it is to receive service through NordicTrack.\nI'm disappointed with the tread, but even more so with the customer service experience. iFit and ActivePulse are great and enjoyable, but ICON Fitness has a lot of work to do if it wants to retain customers that otherwise will make the jump to Peloton and other fitness brands that provide for an easier installation/delivery experience and much more responsive customer service.\nAfter I bought this treadmill, I also purchased a NordicTrack S22i bike from Amazon. The bike was defective and unusable. To this day, NordicTrack hasn't responded to my messages or called me to remediate the issue. I finally returned the bike through Amazon's stellar customer service and was rid of it. I purchased a Peloton Bike+ instead, and it's been a night and day experience all around.\nI also purchased a NordicTrack Vault directly through NordicTrack and haven't had any issues with it. Thankfully, because I wouldn't know whom to turn to other than my credit card company.\nNordicTrack equipment is solid and iFit is a bit frustrating to use but good when it works (it is lightyears behind robust apps like the Peloton app in terms of usability).

BIG MISTAKE!\nFirst, it was an enormous chore putting it together. It took our genius handyman almost three hours of hard work to get it up and running. Second, the IFit \"free-for-a-year\" classes are terrible. We use a Peloton bike and their programming and there is simply no comparison on quality of instructor, production and engagement. IFit stinks.\nBut we would have sucked all of this up and not written this review except for our third problem: our machine puts out a loud and irritating beep no matter what we do.

I managed to put it together in about an hour and only needed my wife to assist for a few minutes at the end. Note that it is very heavy - if you can, have the delivery people put it where you are going to assemble it.\nAll the controls (incline, speed, volume) seem to be well placed and easy to reach (I'm 5' 10\"). I find it comfortable for walking and running - no complaints there. It runs quiet, but the motor to raise and lower the incline can be loud and annoying.\nI spent the first few weeks going through the included (free) iFit workouts and did some multiple times before signing up for the one year trial. This provided a good preview of what's available within the iFit app and lets you see which trainers you may like. Overall, I really like the iFit app and find it very motivational. I was expecting it to be just videos of scenic places but it provides much more than I expected - it's sort of like going for a run with a friend who talks to you the whole time and tells you interesting facts about the area, people, culture, etc. The speed and incline adjusts automatically with the video but can be overridden if you want to go faster/slower or raise/decrease the incline.\nThe 14\" screen is adequate.

I suspect the grips aren't working properly and that'd be my guess as to why. I'm enjoying the ifit workouts but have no plan to renew once the free year is up because it's so expensive. So far the machine seems sturdy. It loses wifi connection from time to time even though other devices are fine. If you use manual mode, it shows a track with your progress.

We contacted Icon Health Fitness the warranty company. They were absolutely no help. They wanted us to take the motor apart and remove the drive belt and take a video of it running. I didnât pay for a warranty so I could take the motor apart. I donât recommend this Nordic Track treadmill and would never do business with Icon Health Fitness"

It arrived to the delivery company on the day prescribed, but then took two days beyond that to get to my home. The box was mangled and the delivery company noted that on the delivery slip. My main floor is essentially a second story because I have a daylight basement. I opened the box in the driveway and brought in the parts I could lift alone. No issues due to the box mangling. Seems very well packed to prevent any major issues in transit. I did need a friend to help bring the running deck in. It's heavy, but easily managed with two people.\nAssembly took about two hours. The instructions and relevant needed parts packaging are very good. I can see where people have issues if they don't fully read the instructions about not tightening certain bolts, but if you actually read what's written, it's all pretty simple. At the end, go back and tighten everything up and it's all good.. Assembly says it needs two people, but its easy enough with just one.\nI didn't sign up for the iFit stuff despite having the year free. Just felt it was over priced and unnecessary for my needs. Not sure why people say you have to sign up for it....it was easily skipped during set up."

     "name": "The NordicTrack 2450 Treadmill is a wonderful piece of equipment. I'm an endurance runner with a larger frame, and I put my equipment to the test. After 6 weeks of heavy use, my 2450 is humming right along with zero issues. The sturdy frame and cushioned tread make for a comfortable run. I utilize the iFit technology to guide my training series', and I love how it provides an opportunity to follow some of my favorite athletes and trainers all over the world. Once you login and choose your workout, the machine does the rest. It automatically controls your speed and incline, and of course you have the option to manually control it as well if that's better for you. The 14\" touchscreen on this machine has excellent clarity and size, and the speakers give off solid sound. The fan is powerful and easy to control. The one touch speed and incline are great as well for my manual workouts. The unit folds-up very easily with the included hydraulic support lift, and is equally as easy to let back down. Assembly took about 2 hours for my wife and I to complete. The directions were satisfactory and we did not have any issues. This machine is of commercial quality and is therefore very heavy. I use it on the second story of my house, and it took 3 grown men to get it up the stairs and to its final location, so keep that in mind. The noise level below when I am running, even at high speeds, is minimal. This is a fantastic piece of equipment, and it has helped me to make great progress in my distance running and overall fitness. I intend to keep it for many years to come."

Wife and I use it 5-6 times a week each since we purchased it and really enjoy it.\nWhile it's easy to fold we never fold it since we are working out daily on it. Assembly was a little rough since it was only my wife and I and delivery was to threshold of home and we unpacked it within the garage and moved the pieces individually to our sunroom were we set it up. The hardest part to move was the base itself.\nBut we are very pleased with this purchase. It goes from -3% to 15% incline which is plenty for us. Top speed is 12mph which neither one of us will ever use."

I haven't got to use the ifit program yet. Only ran on it on manual mode so it doesn't incline and mess up the motor. I'm glad I bought insurance or I'd be s.o.l right now.\nOver all we got the 14 inch screen which is perfect. The program you can use if you have a rowing machine or bike. We don't have the nordictrack ones but the program still works. I just hope to get this fixed because I bought this for the incline and program that goes with it. Right now it's just an ordinary tredmill."

I had a technician put it together for me and it was well worth not putting my husband through the aggravation. The monitor is a nice size and tilts down if your short like me and has a fan for cooling (bonus). Being stuck home in our current environment I have to say its a life saver and I'm very pleased with it! The only thing I had an issue with was placing the treadmill where I wanted it. They had it on a truck that had a lift to lower it. It's super heavy so keep that in mind if there are any stairs involved. But once in place it folds up nicely with wheels if you ever did need to move it. Overall very happy with my purchase."

We tried all the standard troubleshooting of power cycling, recalibrating the incline, etc all with no success. We then tried to contact NordicTrack support, and after trying everyday for a week with no response, we returned the defective item to Amazon for a refund.\nThe treadmill seemed solid, and if it worked I'm sure it would have been great.

The instructions were very clear and my husband and son were able to build the treadmill without a problem. I will say that assembly is probably a two person job, since the machine is substantial and might be too heavy for one person. We are all really enjoying the iFit workouts - from the hikes in the Alps to walking tours of the Egyptian pyramids to runs around Paris. There is a workout for every level of fitness. I would highly recommend this treadmill to anyone who is wanting a great commercial quality treadmill for their home."

Youâre gonna need help â but again not a bad thing in terms of build quality, it just makes for a harder assembly.\nWhat I liked about the product is the quality, itâs not too terribly noisy, about on par with what youâd expect from a commercial gym treadmill, comes with cool work out programs built in, and it folds up pretty nicely if you need it to. Itâs also got Bluetooth so you can hook your devices up to it and play music or watch media through your phone or laptop.\nWhat I didnât like is that there are absolutely no USB ports for charging or linking your phone to. I think it would be nice to have applications along with the interface, like YouTube, Spotify, or even just web browser functionality since this thing actually connects to the internet. Maybe they can update that with a software update or something.\nOverall, nice package for its intended purpose which is working out...just a missed opportunity in regards to features that I would have liked to see."

Now I had it disassembled and reboxed, which took nearly 4 hours. Nordic Track costumer service told me on the phone on March 18 that they would do in-home assembly by their expert for a fee. But that was no longer an option a day later when I tried placing the order with them directly and they urged me to order via Amazon because it works arrive 1-2 weeks earlier in only 7-9 days. Nordic Track would not respond to my emails or calls for 5 days. I was on hold for 40 minutes and they told me to return the defective item to Amazon because of burnt smell could be a fire hazard and the Decline Motor noise was abnormally high at 3x the loudness that we heard inside gyms and the cushion lever for \"soft\" or firm did not work or change or move more than a 1/8th a turn and was supposed to turn much more and lock in for cushion softness change but it did not."

Definitely didn't expect this to happen so fast with a commercial series. Reaching Nordictrack customer service rep was difficult (lots of hits and tries) but once reached, after few troubleshooting steps, she helped with a replacement order for the controller. But the sad part is that the time to deliver is not clear (it could take 4 to 6 weeks) therefore my training is messed up now. I have to revert to my four years old Weslo which is still working fine (after a motor belt replacement).\nMy one star rating (there isn't an option of 0) is due to lack of reliability of this machine and no clarity (delay) on the time to get the replacement part. I understand that things can go wrong but a better support in terms of atleast a faster delivery would have prompted me to give a better rating."

It connected to the internet quickly and I was able to go on a hike within about 15-20 minutes of final assembly. The fans work great and the sound is pretty great through bluetooth."

It comes with a one-year iFit membership, which has running classes where it controls your treadmill. I gotta say - the part where your treadmill is auto-controlled is very cool! And the hidden benefit is that it takes \"more work\" to lower the setting so you're more likely to stick with the program as long as you make time for exercising.\nThe console is quite big. I thought of ordering the bigger treadmill for the bigger console but I was happy with this screen size. The one with the bigger console is much more expensive, but I also found out it has a steeper incline, which some trainers mention + use during classes.\nOne downside: the console is buggy and slow. Very. Slow. It constantly updates information and it doesn't seem like they cache very much information (I'm an engineer). The frame rates are also very low, making it feel very sluggish.\nOverall: I'm pretty happy with this machine. I no longer have any excuses about why I didn't get a workout in since it's in the corner of my living room."

Here we are 7 weeks after it stopped working and guess what no console. Called back again and they gave the same story. Asked to be escalated up to someone else and told there is no one for me to talk to and there is nothing they can do. It will be another 2 to 3 weeks maybe.

I find the machine to be smooth and at 200 lb's it handles my weight with no issues- even when at speeds and at an incline the motor never seems taxed nor does it slip. My only complaint is I cant see how to set manual timed programs, it's just run until you're done then manually initiate a cool down, but otherwise the machine is powerful, smooth and stable- highly recommend"

They offered some general suggestions, none of which worked and even suggested that I just return it, but could not get me a replacement for WEEKS. So I'm stuck with a defective treadmill that I'm not expecting to last, having paid for premium support, which is apparently worth nothing. IF it worked well, this would be a good treadmill.

I did have some initial issues with videos pausing because of my wifi but realized it was my old router causing the problem. Make sure you get a newer router model and you wonât have issues. Ever since I upgraded my router, I have had no issues at all.\nOnly reason I didnât give easy to assemble a 5-star rating is that the whole thing weighs over 350 lbs and it took the entire family to move it to our basement.

The manual notes you should not use power tools for the screws utilized in both the ground screw and side rail mounts, but they are so poorly machined it takes that force (albeit gentle) from a drill to seat the screws.

     "name": "This is a great machine. It replaced my old circa 2004 era treadmill and the advances on this machine are just amazing. I love just how sturdy the machine is and the little extras that are there. It has a nice powerful motor, which is relatively quiet for a treadmill motor. The built in fan is a nice extra while running to help keep me cool. I was pretty skeptical on the ifit programs at first, but I have found I really enjoy the routes w/ the trainers and the fact that the treadmill auto adjust speed and incline/decline automatically is great for providing a nice varied workout."
    },
    {
     "name": "This treadmill is trash. The belt snags and the incline stopped working after about 4 months. If you start looking for solutions to the incline issue, youâll find itâs a known problem with this machine."
    },
    {
     "name": "I love this treadmill! I even love the iFit subscription that comes with it. The treadmill is quiet, responds well with the iFit program and makes running all those miles so much more bearable. The fans are the best Iâve ever had on a treadmill too."
    },
    {
     "name": "This treadmill has changed my life. I wanted one for running on days when it is raining, as it often does here, and for when I would be running after dark or alone. I LOVE the iFit features, the stability of the treadmill itself, and the relative ease with which we were able to assemble it. You will need 2 people for assembly, this thing is heavy! So far the set up has been simple, the year of iFit will be well utilized, and the machine is far superior to those at the gym. This is perhaps my favorite purchase ever."
    },
    {
     "name": "Great treadmill! I bought it in August 2020 and use it 5 out of 7 days a week. Easy to use, big and sturdy platform. This is a big machine, so it is strong and heavy. Love the IFit app. You can also customize a map where you want to run. Very please with the machine. No more excuses for not working out."
    },
    {
     "name": "In less than a years Iâm having issues with fans not working, rust on sensor handles and sudden shut downs of treadmill with the workouts still playing on the screen. I would save a little more money and get a PELOTON treadmill. Iâm very disappointed with the rust issue with the emergency key magnet and metal sensors on handles (heart rate)"
    },
    {
     "name": "Our first one had a bent frame it was a nightmare having to return and get a different one. Probably wouldn't order another one through Amazon just for the reason of pain in the butt to return. Loved the machine once we got one that was in all working condition"
    },
    {
     "name": "I purchased it in August 4th, 2020. In November 30, 2020, it is not working. It is no longer running. The quality is not good as it is advised. It is not worth for over $2600."
    },
    {
     "name": "As many other reviewers stated - It was dead on arrival. After spending 2.5 hours assembling everything, it never worked. The main console is dead.\nThere is clearly power in the system (static sound in speakers and flashing bluetooth light), but everything else is dead.\nI'll return and I recommend everyone to stay away. Still no idea how the return of this 300lbs weight is going to go"
    },
    {
     "name": "Honestly, this is one if the best purchases Iâve ever made. Iâve always hated cardio, but I find myself using this treadmill every single morning. The reason is the iFit trainers that are greeting me every morning. I find myself immersed in the experience of hiking up Mount Fuji, hiking around Lake Tahoe, running on a beach in Kauai, through the streets in Iceland, or through the streets of India. The treadmill itself is very smooth, and has declines of -3 all the way up to incline of 15 degrees. The speed and incline adjust automatically according to the training program you are following. Itâs really an awesome machine that has gotten me off my butt. Highly recommended."
    },
    {
     "name": "Great when it works. The iFit app is terrible. It hasn't automatically loaded for months. And if your WiFi goes out forget about using it, even in manual mode. I'll never buy a treadmill that has iFit on it again. And it constantly squeaks. I would skip this brand and look for something else."
    },
    {
     "name": "I bought one of these, and after using it every other day for a month, the right side felt like it was about to break in 2 when I took a step on it. I checked the floorboard and it wasnt cracked. Nordictrack couldnt tell me what the problem was, so I returned it and got a replacement through amazon. This time the same thing happened after using it 5-6 times. I weight 233, the max weight is supposedly 300. Nordictrack still cant help me, so I'm retunring this one and never using them again"
    },
    {
     "name": "Purchased in Feb 2021, received older model NTL172219. New model is NTL17221. Let just say I was not happy to pay the same price offered by Nordictrak for the newer model."
    },
    {
     "name": "This is great product for your home. I have it in my office and it runs very quiet and I love the large screen. It also folds up really nice to save space and is easy to get the track back down. The fans work great and the touch screen is very responsive. I did pay extra to have it installed as it's not a one person job and is semi-complex. Overall, I couldn't be happier."
    },
    {
     "name": "It is a great machine and as all the reviews say, it is probably the best you can get for your home gym. I love the fact that it has enough space for you to run and you do not feel like you are in a tight space. Also the screen is awesome and the content through iFit makes running experience a very engaging experience. Highly recommended."
    },
    {
     "name": "Great Treadmill! It was always hard and time consuming to get to the gym, but it's also boring to work out at home. ifit makes it enjoyable to work out at home while pushing you to your limits. I end up working out much more than I did before and I'm finally learning how to be a runner!"

     "name": "I HAD THIS MACHINE FOR ONLY THREE MONTHS AND THE RUNNING BOARD BROKE IN THE MIDDLE DURING EXERCISE."
    },
    {
     "name": "I set up the treadmill in the garage. Assembly was not too difficult. The treadmill works great and is getting a lot of use from 4 family members. We love the iFit coach and the large selection of workouts. The sound system and cooling fan are major pluses. The workout time just flies by. A couple of the parts were damaged in transit (nothing major). Due to CoVid-19 delays, it took a bit of time to receive replacement parts, but they did come eventually."
    },
    {
     "name": "Love the 14 inch screen and free iFit! It was more challenging to put together than I expected."
    },
    {
     "name": "It completely met my expectations!"
    },
    {
     "name": "Love this piece of equipment and the iFit membership that comes with it. It's not as loud as we expected, and the extra assembly service was a must. Beware Amazon's standard delivery as they may simply get it inside your house and not drop to the desired location, so this is good to determine in advance. Regardless, the product is great!"
    },
    {
     "name": "The Nordictrack 2450 has to be one of the greatest treadmills Iâve even ran on. It has a smooth running belt and when you turn on the belt softener it gets even smoother. I truly have to say that the iFit workouts are something else, they really make you feel like youâre in the destination you choose. Nodictrack spared no expense on this treadmill. Iâd highly recommend this treadmill for a experienced runner or someone looking for something different on a day to day basis. GREAT JOB NORDICTRACK!!!"
    },
    {
     "name": "The product was delivered in a timely manner. Unfortunately when unloading the item or prior to loading 3 pieces of the equipment had broken. The gentleman we hired pointed them out and thankfully did not affect the use of the treadmill. Just a little upset after paying so much we already have digs and broken pieces. Hoping I will Be able to get them replaced."
    },
    {
     "name": "I use this treadmill about 4 times a week and 4 to 5 miles a day and so far so good. I have a good time using this treadmill. My husband put it together and the only time I needed to help him, was when I had to hold up the treadmill as he was fixing the lift part."
    },
    {
     "name": "The return policy will cost you - even if the frame was bent in manufacturing. Iâm out $400 for a restocking fee on a machine that I used for less than a week. Maybe this is how Bezos is a billionaire. Robbing me of $400."
    },
    {
     "name": "This Nordictrack treadmill is AMAZING! Perfect for working out. Glad I went with the 14â screen. Itâs more expensive than the 10â one but definitely worth it. The belt is big enough to walk or run. The assembly part was tough so I had to get the Amazon service guy to do it. He did a fairly good job and was able to do it quickly.\nI would recommend getting iFit with it because their workouts are awesome! And I definitely recommend this product!!"
    },
    {
     "name": "I was able to use the iFit 2 times before the screen started to have trouble. There was a long wait to get help when calling, over 45 minutes. I need to get a new screen, so will have to wait even more time before being able to use it. So, my year free subscription is not getting used."
    },
    {
     "name": "Excellent machine. I bought it based on independent reviews as well as Amazon customers without a test run. I am not disappointed. It is an excellent product and would recommend it. The iFit is not my favorite as I use the manual run feature the most but my wife enjoys the trainer assisted interval workouts. We will see if I continue it after the 1 year subscription however, the 14 inch screen is a plus. Assembled myself in about 90 minutes. Last two screws in the display were the hardest, but all in all an easy assemble."
    },
    {
     "name": "Love the product with the integrated IFit membership. Had a problem right out of the box and it took a few weeks to get all the the right parts and work as expected, but all better now."
    },
    {
     "name": "Stopped working less than a month after having it. Stuck in decline decline position. Also super creaky when running. Very surprised for a brand new treadmill. We would not recommend."
    },
    {
     "name": "While assembly is a bit of a challenge, 2 people can do it in a few hours. The treadmill itself is performing very well. The iFit training is excellent and motivating. I highly recommend this equipment."
    },
    {
     "name": "Iâm a big dude, 6â4â and range anywhere from 275-300. I was a bit skeptical that the Nordictrack would put up with me. I have been more than happy with the machine. The combination of the treadmill with the Ifit trainers is superb, and in one word, I am AMAZED at the system as a whole! Iâve gotten accustomed to âtravelingâ on my morning workouts; I suggest walking the guided tours of Japan with Masato."
    },
    {
     "name": "I LOVE this commercial treadmill! It is well built and easy to assemble. My husband and I have used it for a couple of days now & like it better than the Sole we had previously."

I have never spent so much money on such garbage, much less garbage that could potentially cause me bodily harm. Nevermind actual exercise, if you value your safety, I highly recommend NOT purchasing this product!"

     "name": "Intoduction: In general, manual treadmills, those without motors, are certainly cheaper than motorized ones. The biggest pro is cost. The next biggest pro is weight - manual treadmills will weigh rather less than any motorized unit worth getting. The con is that your body dictates the speed, and how you walk on the unit can cause the unit to stop. Meaning you should be positioned toward the middle of the platform and not close to the front, or a bit farther back, for a more consistent walk. Since your body powers the belt, this means your body has to start it up. This does add momentary wear'n'tear to one's preferred knee. Those with arthritis would find this to be a potential downside.\nAlso, for any treadmill, have a pair of NEW shoes, dedicated SOLELY for the treadmill. That way it doesn't get covered in muck and stuff. Also, get some good insoles like memory foam to help out your joints.\nWhat's good:\n* The TR3000 is largely pre-assembled out of the box. It took me about 15 minutes to unpack and set up the unit.\n* It comes with oil to lubricate to reduce friction - READ THE MANUAL about how and when to use it, my booklet has age 15 devoted to the section \"Lubrication\".\n* feels very sturdy, even right out of the box\n* 75 pounds makes it easy to move\n* has 2 incline settings, I've kept it at the default one for a nice gentle mild up-hill feel. Will look into the other setting eventually. :)\n* 300LB weight limit\nWhat's not good:\n* It's a bit louder than I'd have thought, hearing the tread scruff against the metal. Then again, not many treadmills are going to be quiet.\n* okay, the litty bitty wheels to move the unit with are arguably too small if you have carpeted floors. But the whole unit weighs so little it's ultimately not much of an issue (for most) to carry if needed.\nWhat's surprising:\n* The magnetic resistance feature, even at setting 1, is pretty cool. Higher settings do lead to more stress on the knee, FYI\n* Documentation for which plug-in goes where for the heart rate and MPH sensors isn't well-defined. But with two heart sensors, one for each handle, it's not too hard to guess which goes where. :)\n* Width of track is thinner than I'd thought but works for my moderate build.\nSummary:\nObviously one can't become an Olympic runner on any manual treadmill, but for basic fitness and even walking during a rainy day and such, this is a pretty great unit and especially for the price. There's not much to nitpick at all about this unit. It's effortlessly easy to set up, sturdy, one can easily walk 3.5MPH on it for some time, even with the angle. The relative loudness is distracting, but minor. The sturdiness is to be commended, so many models have people saying they're wobbly and rickety."

     "name": "My husband and I are thrilled to finally have a little fitness center in our basement. This treadmill was the finishing piece.\nPros: It's lightweight, relatively quiet, uses no electricity (except for the battery-powered monitor), and is very compact.\nCons: It's got very stiff resistance. The incline settings are pretty steep, and there is no \"flat\" setting. Even at the lowest setting, we find ourselves working much harder. There's no way to gradually work your way up from easy to vigorous. I thought maybe it was the incline, so I placed a 1\" thick board under the back to reduce the incline. I added some more oil for good measure, just to be sure it was lubricated enough. Turns out it's even HARDER to walk on if it's flat! The incline actually helps to move the belt because of your body weight pulling it down.\nBut I still like it, because I get a good workout. I'm used to walking long distances, so I'm in reasonably good shape. Anyone who is sedentary and wants to build up their stamina had better start with a different treadmill, or maybe just walk around the neighborhood for a couple of months first."

     "name": "I love how early this was delivered. My partner put it together for me in less than 30 minutes. I'm about 280 lbs and this holds my weight which is what matters to me. It's small enough to fit in my livingroom. Another bonus since I can watch movies. I live in a flat area so the incline helps give an extra amount of exercise.\nOne thing that I do not really like is the resistance options. I have the resistance at the highest level but I am not noticing a difference. I purchased a pair of sneakers for using this treadmill but I find that barefoot is better for the resistance. My sneakers have solid grips so, maybe that has an effect on how well it works? That is my only little complaint. I can go barefoot to get some good exercise as long as I am just walking.\nI was missing my daily walking routine so this machine is a lifesaver!"

There is not.\nI haven't had it long enough to speak of any issues that are time related, but ,so far, I am very pleased. The box was not damaged. Everything inside was well cushioned. The setup was simple. It does not move at all when in use. It is sturdy. And (some reviews spoke of noise) there is nothing coming from the treadmill that is noisy. The only sound is that of my feet coming down, and even that doesn't sound as load as it did on the motorized treadmill that I had. That my be because I am pushing the belt backwards with my foot rather than just dropping my foot and having the belt pull it backwards."

     "name": "Motor powered (rather than user body weight on the incline) tread mill operation is more stable and predicatble, setable. For the lighweight, low cost, and simple use and maintaince of the this type of device I get a great workout of the type I need as a fat burning diabetic. I am slightly taller (6'00\") than the usual ergonocs of thins like wheel chair or hand rail handles and also for altering position I added a couple of ropes on I can use to keep a stable place on the tread as well as work alittle truned to the right, left, straight up, or leaning forwards body positions. Initially (I weigh 230 pounds) the magnet resistance system did not slow me enough and I added some plywood under the rear support to lower the platform angle. Because of either a move on the floor or the tread working in some way, the angle was fine and I removed the platform. It is wonderful slow walk burn to watch TV, YouTube walking in forest videos, bikine contests, or music videos, or TV news or sci fi movies. I easily can go into a full run at for me say 5 or 5.5 mph, and at that speed the device works most easily and its best. Turning the resistance dial works well. I usse a high power fan far away or a quiet small fan nearby so the TV is not interfered with. What I like best is that if I used for 30 minutes in the morning the timer stops when I stoop using it and at lunch it starts at 31 minutes. This continues up to 99 minutes or you press RESET on the computer panel. I have set a goal for 99 mins a day at least, which is much like a step counting goal.\nAs it wears in to normal lube level, etc., it is working great and I am discovering it is the ultimate low impact faster than power walk slow run or fast run, at the machines best. Excellent muscle usage moving the treadmill means very high caloric expenditure without having to hammer knees and joints at faster speeds keeping up the motor doing the work. As light jog or jog/powerwalk gate no hand rails needed as I use it, keeps even good pace."

     "name": "First off, I like the product. The customer service however is close to non-existent!! The product arrived with a broken knob that is used to hold the deck in the vertical position. I put the pin and spring back into the unit and put tape around the two halves of the plastic knob to hold them. That seemed to work but didn't look all that great. I put the legs on the unit, which is the onlt sssembly that is required, and tested it. It worked great from walking up to a light jog but the heart rate monitor was the only function that worked. I found that the Sensor with Wire was the culprit. This is the sensor that drives every function but the heart rate. I googled it and found an adjustment procedure that called for loosening the sensor mounting screw and rotating the sensor to be as close to wheel as possible without touching it. That did not work.. The timer, odometer, calories burned, current distance traveled, etc. Every function relies on this one component and it was DOA. I registered my product with ParadigmHW, the maker of the unit. And promptly submitted a request for service on 1/25/2018. I then called customer support on 1/29/2018 to make sure my registration and part request was processing. I got no answer on the phone after two separate attempts. So, I went to their website and chatted with a customer service agent. After 15 minutes of providing my info ans the serial number, I was asked if I had a ticket number from the service request. But they do not give ticket numbers. I got a screen saying that you for registering. I asked if my product was even registered. I was asked to wait for the third time and after a minute or two I was disconnected from the chat. I clicked the chat button to re-engage a customer service agent and got a message that chat service was not available. Frustrated and annoyed, I decided to just request a refund. And im glad I did. The next day, I get an email saying there is no record of my email in their system.\nWhat annoyed me more than anything.. is that this one sensor is a known issue. It's all over the net and in the product reviews. So instead of hassling your customers, why not just replace the part. The website states customer service is 24/7.. but of course its not. You can fill out a form and be contacted later.. thats not 24/7 customer service. Since the box was pretty beat up and the styrofoam was crushed in many places, i had to pay for it to be repacked for the return shipping. I should rhave just rejected the delivery and had them pick it back up\nI basically liked this product! it is VERY unfortunate that it arrived broken. Any warranty is utterly useless if the manufacturer wont stand behind it and actually deliver the support that it promises."

     "name": "My husband & I are both enjoying the treadmill. We easily set it up and it works great. It gives a good workout because you're always walking up an incline. Good for me the way it is but my husband ratchets the resistance up which makes it a bit harder workout. We are very happy with it. No wires at all. Gravity gets you started because of the incline. When it was delivered the box was really beat up. It's long and heavy for 1 delivery person to maneuver. Holes showed where he had tried to get a better hold on it. They should pack it more securely. Nevertheless it was unscathed & works great."

     "name": "I am 65, and I like having a treadmill in the house, as I live in the mountains where the weather gets snowy and cold in the winter, inhibiting outdoor walking at my age (fell and broke my arm last year). The only problem I have with it, is the manual really doesn't explain how to set the settings on the computer. I used it again today, and still can't get a reading on the speed and distance. Perhaps someone can she some light on this. Maybe I am just not walking fast enough nor long enough to register a speed on the computer? Not that it's all that important, because I am still going to walk for as long and as fast as I want, it would just be nice I guess, to know."

     "name": "Intoduction: In general, manual treadmills, those without motors, are certainly cheaper than motorized ones. The biggest pro is cost. The next biggest pro is weight - manual treadmills will weigh rather less than any motorized unit worth getting. The con is that your body dictates the speed, and how you walk on the unit can cause the unit to stop. Meaning you should be positioned toward the middle of the platform and not close to the front, or a bit farther back, for a more consistent walk. Since your body powers the belt, this means your body has to start it up. This does add momentary wear'n'tear to one's preferred knee. Those with arthritis would find this to be a potential downside.\nAlso, for any treadmill, have a pair of NEW shoes, dedicated SOLELY for the treadmill. That way it doesn't get covered in muck and stuff. Also, get some good insoles like memory foam to help out your joints.\nWhat's good:\n* The TR3000 is largely pre-assembled out of the box. It took me about 15 minutes to unpack and set up the unit.\n* It comes with oil to lubricate to reduce friction - READ THE MANUAL about how and when to use it, my booklet has age 15 devoted to the section \"Lubrication\".\n* feels very sturdy, even right out of the box\n* 75 pounds makes it easy to move\n* has 2 incline settings, I've kept it at the default one for a nice gentle mild up-hill feel. Will look into the other setting eventually. :)\n* 300LB weight limit\nWhat's not good:\n* It's a bit louder than I'd have thought, hearing the tread scruff against the metal. Then again, not many treadmills are going to be quiet.\n* okay, the litty bitty wheels to move the unit with are arguably too small if you have carpeted floors. But the whole unit weighs so little it's ultimately not much of an issue (for most) to carry if needed.\nWhat's surprising:\n* The magnetic resistance feature, even at setting 1, is pretty cool. Higher settings do lead to more stress on the knee, FYI\n* Documentation for which plug-in goes where for the heart rate and MPH sensors isn't well-defined. But with two heart sensors, one for each handle, it's not too hard to guess which goes where. :)\n* Width of track is thinner than I'd thought but works for my moderate build.\nSummary:\nObviously one can't become an Olympic runner on any manual treadmill, but for basic fitness and even walking during a rainy day and such, this is a pretty great unit and especially for the price. There's not much to nitpick at all about this unit. It's effortlessly easy to set up, sturdy, one can easily walk 3.5MPH on it for some time, even with the angle. The relative loudness is distracting, but minor. The sturdiness is to be commended, so many models have people saying they're wobbly and rickety."

     "name": "My husband and I are thrilled to finally have a little fitness center in our basement. This treadmill was the finishing piece.\nPros: It's lightweight, relatively quiet, uses no electricity (except for the battery-powered monitor), and is very compact.\nCons: It's got very stiff resistance. The incline settings are pretty steep, and there is no \"flat\" setting. Even at the lowest setting, we find ourselves working much harder. There's no way to gradually work your way up from easy to vigorous. I thought maybe it was the incline, so I placed a 1\" thick board under the back to reduce the incline. I added some more oil for good measure, just to be sure it was lubricated enough. Turns out it's even HARDER to walk on if it's flat! The incline actually helps to move the belt because of your body weight pulling it down.\nBut I still like it, because I get a good workout. I'm used to walking long distances, so I'm in reasonably good shape. Anyone who is sedentary and wants to build up their stamina had better start with a different treadmill, or maybe just walk around the neighborhood for a couple of months first."

     "name": "I love how early this was delivered. My partner put it together for me in less than 30 minutes. I'm about 280 lbs and this holds my weight which is what matters to me. It's small enough to fit in my livingroom. Another bonus since I can watch movies. I live in a flat area so the incline helps give an extra amount of exercise.\nOne thing that I do not really like is the resistance options. I have the resistance at the highest level but I am not noticing a difference. I purchased a pair of sneakers for using this treadmill but I find that barefoot is better for the resistance. My sneakers have solid grips so, maybe that has an effect on how well it works? That is my only little complaint. I can go barefoot to get some good exercise as long as I am just walking.\nI was missing my daily walking routine so this machine is a lifesaver!"

     "name": "After reading all the reviews about this machine and another one that is identical, I felt sure that when I received the treadmill there would be something negative to say. There is not.\nI haven't had it long enough to speak of any issues that are time related, but ,so far, I am very pleased. The box was not damaged. Everything inside was well cushioned. The setup was simple. It does not move at all when in use. It is sturdy. And (some reviews spoke of noise) there is nothing coming from the treadmill that is noisy. The only sound is that of my feet coming down, and even that doesn't sound as load as it did on the motorized treadmill that I had. That my be because I am pushing the belt backwards with my foot rather than just dropping my foot and having the belt pull it backwards."

They are too small, making scratching the floor very likely and not smooth to move over carpet."

I do not use the handles when I run but when I walk I have no choice but to use the handles.\nThis is a 5 star machine and this is one of the best investments"

     "name": "Motor powered (rather than user body weight on the incline) tread mill operation is more stable and predicatble, setable. For the lighweight, low cost, and simple use and maintaince of the this type of device I get a great workout of the type I need as a fat burning diabetic. I am slightly taller (6'00\") than the usual ergonocs of thins like wheel chair or hand rail handles and also for altering position I added a couple of ropes on I can use to keep a stable place on the tread as well as work alittle truned to the right, left, straight up, or leaning forwards body positions. Initially (I weigh 230 pounds) the magnet resistance system did not slow me enough and I added some plywood under the rear support to lower the platform angle. Because of either a move on the floor or the tread working in some way, the angle was fine and I removed the platform. It is wonderful slow walk burn to watch TV, YouTube walking in forest videos, bikine contests, or music videos, or TV news or sci fi movies. I easily can go into a full run at for me say 5 or 5.5 mph, and at that speed the device works most easily and its best. Turning the resistance dial works well. I usse a high power fan far away or a quiet small fan nearby so the TV is not interfered with. What I like best is that if I used for 30 minutes in the morning the timer stops when I stoop using it and at lunch it starts at 31 minutes. This continues up to 99 minutes or you press RESET on the computer panel. I have set a goal for 99 mins a day at least, which is much like a step counting goal.\nAs it wears in to normal lube level, etc., it is working great and I am discovering it is the ultimate low impact faster than power walk slow run or fast run, at the machines best. Excellent muscle usage moving the treadmill means very high caloric expenditure without having to hammer knees and joints at faster speeds keeping up the motor doing the work. As light jog or jog/powerwalk gate no hand rails needed as I use it, keeps even good pace."

     "name": "I bought this treadmill in February and wanted to use it for a while before writing a review. I was looking for a good basic treadmill that could sustain running, had a small footprint and was light enough for one person to move around. This treadmill met my needs, but it doesn't have a lot of fancy features. It has different running programs, 3 incline options and a pulse checker.\nI used to run 8-10 miles a day on the treadmill for several years, but stopped due to a back injury. I got this treadmill to gradually get back into shape after back surgery and use it about 3-4 times a week for about an hour each time.\n1. It is very sturdy for running. Although it's smaller, it feels roomy because of the shorter sides. It has a little give and cushion when your foot strikes, so it absorbs some impact. That was a big plus for me because of my back issue.\n2. You can control speed/turn it on & off, and check your pulse on the handles, which is very convenient.\n3. The cup holders are very small and fit a small/medium water bottle. Bigger water bottles will fit, but will bounce off during a workout.\n4. I had to buy a separate clear rack to hold my iPad because there isn't anywhere to put it. The top of the display is curved, so I used velcro stickers to keep the rack in place since it slid around during runs.\n5. Mine arrived with a damaged box and some visible damage to the right side of the treadmill. I still haven't gotten around to contacting the company to discuss, but my treadmill is a little crooked when I fold it up and I have to adjust the belt once a week. Adjusting the belt is super easy.\n6. It is light enough for one person to move. It was a little awkward at first to get it tilted into rolling position, but once you do it's easy to move around.\n7. So far, I'm quite pleased with it and would recommend it if you want a good, basic treadmill without a lot of bells and whistles."

     "name": "I bought the Sunny SF-T7603 treadmill for $339.95 in March 2017. I have used it daily for over a year with only a few missed days. I am 6'1\" and weigh 140 pounds. I walk at 4.0 mph for 25 minutes a day. I can't comment on the programs and features I don't use, but for my specific use the treadmill has worked great. It does exactly what I need for a reasonable price.\nHere are the treadmill actions I take each session.\n1. Turn the power on at the base.\n2. Stand on the belt and connect the safety key's clip to the front of my shirt.\n3. Press the Mode button on the console.\n4. Press the + button on the console until the time display shows 25:00 minutes.\n5. Press the Start button on the console.\n6. Wait for the 3-second countdown to complete and show a speed 0.5 mph.\n7. Press the 4 mph button on the console to change the speed to 4.0 mph.\n8. Walk for 25 minutes until the belt stops automatically when the time is up.\n9. Unclip the safety key from my shirt.\n10. Turn off the power button at the base.\nI'll comment on several things that some people might like to know.\nDuring installation the bolt I used to connect the right upright to the console turned freely in the hole without tightening. The bolt's threads were faulty. Luckily, the bolt I removed from the safety block in one of the first steps was the same size. I used the safety block's bolt in the right upright and it worked perfectly.\nI followed the instructions in the manual to adjust the belt several times during the first few weeks. After I finally got it just right I didn't have to adjust it anymore.\nOiling the running board underneath the belt is awkward and messy. I use the bent wire end of a large paperclip to lift up the edge of the belt on each side for oiling. I let the console tell me when it's time to oil again, which the manual says is every 188 miles. The container of oil that came with the treadmill has lasted a year.\nThe pulse monitor does not work as I expected and I don't know how to interpret the results. The instructions say to hold the pulse monitors for 5 seconds to display your heartbeat in beats per minute. If I hold the pulse monitors for 5 seconds, the display says my pulse is 72 no matter how long I've been walking. If I continue to hold the pulse monitors as I walk the display slowly climbs to 140-150. If I let go and hold for 5 seconds again, it shows 72 again and slowly climbs again. I asked Sunny Technical Support how to interpret those readings. They answered that it gives an estimate of my heart rate and is not medical grade. I know my heart rate doesn't slow to 72 and slowly climb to 150 every time I release and hold the pulse monitors. I'm guessing that when the display finally stops climbing it is showing my heart rate, but that may not be correct and I have no confidence in the readings.\nAt the end of my 25 minutes the belt slows to a stop and a few seconds later all the data on the console clears to zeroes. If you're not attentive and quick to read the data you won't see how far you walked or how many calories you burned.\nThe display shows the speed in large digits and uses much smaller digits for the time, distance, calories, and pulse. My speed is always 4.0, so that number is of the least interest to me, but it is the only one I can easily read without my glasses.\nI like to swing my arms when I walk. I have to be very careful not to let my hands hit the handles.\nThe manual says, \"Your product is intended for use in cool, dry conditions.\" I do not use air conditioning and my treadmill room is frequently 90Â°F in the summer. So far the treadmill has worked flawlessly without overheating.\nThe attached pictures show the console, the left handle, and the right handle."

     "name": "Buyer beware! The customer service and tech support for this treadmill are horrible. My treadmill started malfunctioning after a few months (speed going up and down by itself). The only way to contact the manufacturer is by email. They sent me instructions to calibrate the treadmill that didn't make sense (\"press the Prog and Mode buttons simultaneously and play with the number that appears until it is calibrated\"). I was able to even out the speed experimenting with this number but then the belt was running at twice the speed set on the display. When I called the phone number in the email that they sent me, I spoke with three different reps, and none of them could explain how to calibrate the machine (there are three settings that come up for calibration: F1 (the one they referred to), F2 and F3. Nobody could explain what F2 and F3 settings are for. When I told one of the persons (Jay) that I was trying to set the speed to the one on the display (it was running at about double the indicated speed), he told me to \"ignore the display and just use it at a comfortable speed\".\nI had to contact a technician online that explained to me the controls and I was able then to set the speed correctly.\nThe customer support people are ignorant about the treadmill, no tech support is available, and there is no much online for this brand, only a very generic video in YouTube. I sent a photo of the controlling board and motor to a technician who told me that the controller and motor are the cheapest he had seen in a long time, the controller has no potentiometer, which is used to manually regulate the motor speed, so my problem had no solution and he was surprised the treadmill lasted as long as it did..."

     "name": "UPDATE: It was great until it wasnât! I have used this treadmill almost daily for 4 to 8 mile runs for the last 10 months. Never had any problems and maintained it per the manual. Then yesterday during my morning run, it just stopped working. The treadmill lost power, had a burning smell and now it wonât turn on. My husband is an engineer and he says the issue is electrical. Iâm glad we got the warranty because I called to report the issue and was given a full refund within a few minutes. Definitely purchasing another extended warranty for the next treadmill, which wonât be from Sunny.âUPDATEDâI waited 2 weeks to write this so I could give a true reviewâI bought this treadmill after my gym was closed due to covid-19. I was a little weary about it because it was inexpensive but due to the 4 star reviews, I went for it and bundled the protection plan. THE GOOD: It was incredibly easy to set up and get started using. It took about 20mins and most of that was taking it out of the box since there was a lot of protective packaging. My boyfriend is a manufacturing engineer and even he mentioned how well it was packaged and the high quality of the packaging for protection. I typically run approx 25 to 30 miles/week at the gym and I was worried about the sturdiness since the weight max is 220lbs. At 5â4, 145lbs, this is more than sturdy enough and it can handle long runs and fast/sprint runs. I havenât been using the lift and roll option much since I have a designated space for it but that works fine also. THE BAD: the incline is manual meaning that once you start a run, youâre on the same incline until you get off and adjust it. I usually like to change incline during runs to challenge myself so this is a drawback but itâs not a huge one. Also, I use this treadmill for running (6.5mph+) only; not walking. My boyfriend, who usually walks on a high incline, says the slower speeds (under 2mph) are jerky. This doesnât effect me at all though; maybe itâs because heâs bigger than I am? OVERALL: this is an insanely good treadmill for the price. I very glad that I took a chance on it."

     "name": "I have had this treadmill for about a week now using it daily. It took me about 30 minutes to set up to fully functioning, out of the box. I'm not very handy, so I was pleased with that. I recommend following the instructions to lubricate the belt before use. The treadmill lubricant is included in the package, no need to purchase separately. The treadmill is very quiet - I watch TV while walking/jogging and the TV only needs to be a reasonable volume to hear it over the treadmill. It is also very lightweight for a treadmill, yet very sturdy. Some low-cost treadmills feel like the wobble or shake when running on them - not the case here. I purchased an equipment mat to place under it which has helped, though I'm not certain if it would be necessary depending on the surface you're using it on. It also came well packaged preventing any damage in transit. Very pleased with the product through a short time of ownership. Provided that it holds up long term, I'd recommend to anyone looking for a treadmill in this price range."

So I had my husband look at it, the belt sounded straining as if itâs ready to snap. I messaged Amazon, and they were quick to response. I contacted the company Sunny Fitness and Health, we were in exchange of email back and forth for a week. A representative said that the sound was normal. How can he say that just by watching a short clip of video I sent him as he requested. I emailed the company SHF again to let them know that the machine is not in a good working condition. In fact, I even purchased an extended two years warranty when I purchased through Amazon. Never heard back from them again. So I guess my next step is to write to BBB.\nWarning to consumers, Never buy this product as the company Never deliver the warranty on this bogus product!!!"

I generally used it 4-5 times a week for 30 minutes at 6 mph, but after only 3 months of use, the speed suddenly began to undulate uncontrollably. I contacted Sunny Health and Fitness multiple times and was sent the same video 3 times with instructions to re-calibrate the treadmill, which I did over a dozen times. This still didn't fix the problem and now the treadmill just continues to speed up no matter what speed it is set on. I'm really disappointed that it stopped working so soon after purchase and that they tech support was unable to listen to what was wrong. I sent them 3 videos of the problem and it did not change their response on how to fix it even though their recommendations didn't work. I specifically bought a brand new treadmill to avoid having to take apart and get rid of a used one that stopped working, but this one stopped working well before any of the used ones I purchased ever did."

Also the belt rubs on one side, I've tried adjusting it several times but it never stays centered once tightened. Will probably have to replace the belt within the next year.

I have had the treadmill for 51 days, of which I have ran 48 days. My runs are longer than before, 40-50 minutes and surprisely the treadmill can handle that.

Over 500 miles still working fine. Upped time of running to about an hour. 4 months in. I do live the machine more often than recommended and I believe itâs played a role in the longevity.\n5 months in over 600 miles and itâs still working great. At this point havenât kept track of the months but I think itâs 6 and 1/2, treadmill still running great well over 700 miles.

     "name": ", and huge major plus, itâs like 99.9% preassembled, to me that is a huge advantage.\nTaking the treadmill from delivery to finished product:\nWhen ordering fitness equipment, no matter if in store or online, itâs good to know what it will take just to get the box inside to get setup. This unit for most may require a partner to help with the box. At just about 120 lbs, itâs pretty heavy, but no heavier than most electric treadmillâs Iâve worked with in my life. The good news is that the actual weight of the treadmill is less (about 103 lbs) and the finished product has smart features for helping to move it around after setup. After getting the box inside and the treadmill out of it, one person could easily manage the rest.\nEverything is packed tightly inside (tape and foam), but what really surprised me, is the assembly on this guy. Assembly is always something to face with fitness equipment, I have never had a piece fully assembled (especially that you buy new) and some that were literally 100 pieces or more. I've put together, for myself and friends, at least a dozen pieces of equipment over the years and this treadmill from Sunny Health was literally 99.9% pre-assembled, all I had to do was add-on a couple plastic covers, and add-in about 8 screws (all the same so thereâs nothing to confuse). Leaving the 8 screws and 8 washers out, there are only 3 total main pieces to assemble. That is crazy easy to manage. The hardware comes with an Allen key and a wrench screwdriver. The tools are good quality and I didn't need anything more than what was provided.\nThe treadmill bed is 100% assembled. The console and arm supports are preassembled and practically âunfoldâ to where they need to be. The instruction manual is easy to follow; with pictures, and of course a limited number of parts to actually deal with. When starting to raise the console assembly, there is part that is removed from the treadmill called a âsafety blockâ. Do yourself a favor and keep this somewhere for any future use. It will make packing the treadmill up so much easier if you ever have to move houses in the future.\nAny fitness equipment out there, just like a car, can use some regular user maintenance including bolt tightening and applying new grease. This particular treadmill comes with a bottle of lubricate oil, and you will want to lubricate the belt before first use (all explained in the manual). Itâs easy to lift the belt, apply, then spread it with a cloth. After that, the manufacturer recommends reapplying oil every 188 miles and there is a built-in reminder to let you know when itâs time, like that feature so I donât have to remember. Also the belt is easy to adjust and tighten as needed using the included Allen key. Don't forget these important steps to keep this, or any fitness equipment you buy lasting a good long time.\nAs mentioned earlier, the belt can be raised off the ground for storage. You know those cabinet doors and drawers that you canât slam? That automatically âslow closeâ to prevent the loud âbangâ? This treadmill, when lowering the running deck, has a similar feature so there is no need to bend to lower the bed, it will gently lower all on its own, so smart and cool. When the belt is lifted, it locks in place so I can tilt the treadmill back, and roll it on its caster wheels for storage in another room.\nLike cars that have hands-free controls on the steering wheel, this treadmill has quick controls on the handrails. For me this means safer stability and control, without having to take my hands off the safety rails to reach to the main console in front of me. I can control speed on the right handle, start/stop on the left handle. The treadmill also has a pulse rate system by grabbing the handrails, so far it works just fine.\nFor safety there is a magnetic key that is required to allow the machine to operate. Itâs also a safety feature to shut down the treadmill in case of accidental falls. What I like about this is that when the key is removed, the treadmill canât even turn on, meaning kids canât mess with it.\nThe absolute minimum speed is 0.5MPH (and where the machine starts at use), absolute maximum speed 9.0MPH. There are quick speed buttons for 2MPH, 4MPH and 6MPH and the treadmill has 9 programmed exercise routines. There is incline (3 levels), itâs manual and easy to adjust with feet on the back with locking pins\nOverall, there is so much more to this"

     "name": "than I thought and I have plenty of room to grow with it. I think it is a great choice for those on a budget. I've owned several machines from the big ICON guys (think ProForm, Golds Gym, Weslo, etc.) and this one is just as good as most of their entry level line too, even better in several regards including bonus features and easy, fast assembly. There is plenty of room on the belt for me (both length and width) and mostly I walk vs run (I like low impact). But this would be a good amount of space for runners out there too, especially with a top speed of 9MPH. The console keeps track of time, speed, distance, and calorie's burned, and itâs all wall powered, no batteries to manage.\nFitness equipment show's it's true self over time, right now a week in I'm very happy with this unit, but if I have any problems or concerns, I'll come back to this review and update. So far Iâm very happy with this treadmill and canât get over how easy assembly was.\n[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]"

Being a single, petite woman, I was naturally worried about handling this heavy machine and having to put it together. I was Pleasantly surprised. I was Able to drag it into my home and lift it out of the box, no problem. The machine essentially comes put together. All it needed was some screws to tighten the top to the bottom. Easy! Took me 30 minutes. Didnât need any help - and works like a dream. So glad I ended up choosing this inexpensive yet efficient model. Itâs exactly what i was looking for. Iâll never go to the gym again !"

     "name": "This treadmill started off great, easy to assembly and fold up. HOWEVER, after a few times using it the computer screen went to junk. Once turned on it would either automatically start on it own and only go up to 0.5 in speed and need to be unplugged to turn off or it would not start at all. My husband took the screen off twice and unplugged/replugged the wires and that did seem to help for a few more uses but it happened again and to honest, Iâm not unscrewing the screen each time to use it, especially since Iâve had for about month. Still waiting to hear back from customer service."

     "name": "I bought this treadmill in February and wanted to use it for a while before writing a review. I was looking for a good basic treadmill that could sustain running, had a small footprint and was light enough for one person to move around. This treadmill met my needs, but it doesn't have a lot of fancy features. It has different running programs, 3 incline options and a pulse checker.\nI used to run 8-10 miles a day on the treadmill for several years, but stopped due to a back injury. I got this treadmill to gradually get back into shape after back surgery and use it about 3-4 times a week for about an hour each time.\n1. It is very sturdy for running. Although it's smaller, it feels roomy because of the shorter sides. It has a little give and cushion when your foot strikes, so it absorbs some impact. That was a big plus for me because of my back issue.\n2. You can control speed/turn it on & off, and check your pulse on the handles, which is very convenient.\n3. The cup holders are very small and fit a small/medium water bottle. Bigger water bottles will fit, but will bounce off during a workout.\n4. I had to buy a separate clear rack to hold my iPad because there isn't anywhere to put it. The top of the display is curved, so I used velcro stickers to keep the rack in place since it slid around during runs.\n5. Mine arrived with a damaged box and some visible damage to the right side of the treadmill. I still haven't gotten around to contacting the company to discuss, but my treadmill is a little crooked when I fold it up and I have to adjust the belt once a week. Adjusting the belt is super easy.\n6. It is light enough for one person to move. It was a little awkward at first to get it tilted into rolling position, but once you do it's easy to move around.\n7. So far, I'm quite pleased with it and would recommend it if you want a good, basic treadmill without a lot of bells and whistles."

     "name": "I bought the Sunny SF-T7603 treadmill for $339.95 in March 2017. I have used it daily for over a year with only a few missed days. I am 6'1\" and weigh 140 pounds. I walk at 4.0 mph for 25 minutes a day. I can't comment on the programs and features I don't use, but for my specific use the treadmill has worked great. It does exactly what I need for a reasonable price.\nHere are the treadmill actions I take each session.\n1. Turn the power on at the base.\n2. Stand on the belt and connect the safety key's clip to the front of my shirt.\n3. Press the Mode button on the console.\n4. Press the + button on the console until the time display shows 25:00 minutes.\n5. Press the Start button on the console.\n6. Wait for the 3-second countdown to complete and show a speed 0.5 mph.\n7. Press the 4 mph button on the console to change the speed to 4.0 mph.\n8. Walk for 25 minutes until the belt stops automatically when the time is up.\n9. Unclip the safety key from my shirt.\n10. Turn off the power button at the base.\nI'll comment on several things that some people might like to know.\nDuring installation the bolt I used to connect the right upright to the console turned freely in the hole without tightening. The bolt's threads were faulty. Luckily, the bolt I removed from the safety block in one of the first steps was the same size. I used the safety block's bolt in the right upright and it worked perfectly.\nI followed the instructions in the manual to adjust the belt several times during the first few weeks. After I finally got it just right I didn't have to adjust it anymore.\nOiling the running board underneath the belt is awkward and messy. I use the bent wire end of a large paperclip to lift up the edge of the belt on each side for oiling. I let the console tell me when it's time to oil again, which the manual says is every 188 miles. The container of oil that came with the treadmill has lasted a year.\nThe pulse monitor does not work as I expected and I don't know how to interpret the results. The instructions say to hold the pulse monitors for 5 seconds to display your heartbeat in beats per minute. If I hold the pulse monitors for 5 seconds, the display says my pulse is 72 no matter how long I've been walking. If I continue to hold the pulse monitors as I walk the display slowly climbs to 140-150. If I let go and hold for 5 seconds again, it shows 72 again and slowly climbs again. I asked Sunny Technical Support how to interpret those readings. They answered that it gives an estimate of my heart rate and is not medical grade. I know my heart rate doesn't slow to 72 and slowly climb to 150 every time I release and hold the pulse monitors. I'm guessing that when the display finally stops climbing it is showing my heart rate, but that may not be correct and I have no confidence in the readings.\nAt the end of my 25 minutes the belt slows to a stop and a few seconds later all the data on the console clears to zeroes. If you're not attentive and quick to read the data you won't see how far you walked or how many calories you burned.\nThe display shows the speed in large digits and uses much smaller digits for the time, distance, calories, and pulse. My speed is always 4.0, so that number is of the least interest to me, but it is the only one I can easily read without my glasses.\nI like to swing my arms when I walk. I have to be very careful not to let my hands hit the handles.\nThe manual says, \"Your product is intended for use in cool, dry conditions.\" I do not use air conditioning and my treadmill room is frequently 90Â°F in the summer. So far the treadmill has worked flawlessly without overheating.\nThe attached pictures show the console, the left handle, and the right handle."

     "name": "Buyer beware! The customer service and tech support for this treadmill are horrible. My treadmill started malfunctioning after a few months (speed going up and down by itself). The only way to contact the manufacturer is by email. They sent me instructions to calibrate the treadmill that didn't make sense (\"press the Prog and Mode buttons simultaneously and play with the number that appears until it is calibrated\"). I was able to even out the speed experimenting with this number but then the belt was running at twice the speed set on the display. When I called the phone number in the email that they sent me, I spoke with three different reps, and none of them could explain how to calibrate the machine (there are three settings that come up for calibration: F1 (the one they referred to), F2 and F3. Nobody could explain what F2 and F3 settings are for. When I told one of the persons (Jay) that I was trying to set the speed to the one on the display (it was running at about double the indicated speed), he told me to \"ignore the display and just use it at a comfortable speed\".\nI had to contact a technician online that explained to me the controls and I was able then to set the speed correctly.\nThe customer support people are ignorant about the treadmill, no tech support is available, and there is no much online for this brand, only a very generic video in YouTube. I sent a photo of the controlling board and motor to a technician who told me that the controller and motor are the cheapest he had seen in a long time, the controller has no potentiometer, which is used to manually regulate the motor speed, so my problem had no solution and he was surprised the treadmill lasted as long as it did..."

     "name": "UPDATE: It was great until it wasnât! I have used this treadmill almost daily for 4 to 8 mile runs for the last 10 months. Never had any problems and maintained it per the manual. Then yesterday during my morning run, it just stopped working. The treadmill lost power, had a burning smell and now it wonât turn on. My husband is an engineer and he says the issue is electrical. Iâm glad we got the warranty because I called to report the issue and was given a full refund within a few minutes. Definitely purchasing another extended warranty for the next treadmill, which wonât be from Sunny.âUPDATEDâI waited 2 weeks to write this so I could give a true reviewâI bought this treadmill after my gym was closed due to covid-19. I was a little weary about it because it was inexpensive but due to the 4 star reviews, I went for it and bundled the protection plan. THE GOOD: It was incredibly easy to set up and get started using. It took about 20mins and most of that was taking it out of the box since there was a lot of protective packaging. My boyfriend is a manufacturing engineer and even he mentioned how well it was packaged and the high quality of the packaging for protection. I typically run approx 25 to 30 miles/week at the gym and I was worried about the sturdiness since the weight max is 220lbs. At 5â4, 145lbs, this is more than sturdy enough and it can handle long runs and fast/sprint runs. I havenât been using the lift and roll option much since I have a designated space for it but that works fine also. THE BAD: the incline is manual meaning that once you start a run, youâre on the same incline until you get off and adjust it. I usually like to change incline during runs to challenge myself so this is a drawback but itâs not a huge one. Also, I use this treadmill for running (6.5mph+) only; not walking. My boyfriend, who usually walks on a high incline, says the slower speeds (under 2mph) are jerky. This doesnât effect me at all though; maybe itâs because heâs bigger than I am? OVERALL: this is an insanely good treadmill for the price. I very glad that I took a chance on it."

     "name": "I have had this treadmill for about a week now using it daily. It took me about 30 minutes to set up to fully functioning, out of the box. I'm not very handy, so I was pleased with that. I recommend following the instructions to lubricate the belt before use. The treadmill lubricant is included in the package, no need to purchase separately. The treadmill is very quiet - I watch TV while walking/jogging and the TV only needs to be a reasonable volume to hear it over the treadmill. It is also very lightweight for a treadmill, yet very sturdy. Some low-cost treadmills feel like the wobble or shake when running on them - not the case here. I purchased an equipment mat to place under it which has helped, though I'm not certain if it would be necessary depending on the surface you're using it on. It also came well packaged preventing any damage in transit. Very pleased with the product through a short time of ownership. Provided that it holds up long term, I'd recommend to anyone looking for a treadmill in this price range."

So I had my husband look at it, the belt sounded straining as if itâs ready to snap. I messaged Amazon, and they were quick to response. I contacted the company Sunny Fitness and Health, we were in exchange of email back and forth for a week. A representative said that the sound was normal. How can he say that just by watching a short clip of video I sent him as he requested. I emailed the company SHF again to let them know that the machine is not in a good working condition. In fact, I even purchased an extended two years warranty when I purchased through Amazon. Never heard back from them again. So I guess my next step is to write to BBB.\nWarning to consumers, Never buy this product as the company Never deliver the warranty on this bogus product!!!"

I contacted Sunny Health and Fitness multiple times and was sent the same video 3 times with instructions to re-calibrate the treadmill, which I did over a dozen times. This still didn't fix the problem and now the treadmill just continues to speed up no matter what speed it is set on. I'm really disappointed that it stopped working so soon after purchase and that they tech support was unable to listen to what was wrong. I sent them 3 videos of the problem and it did not change their response on how to fix it even though their recommendations didn't work.

I dithered for a couple weeks before ordering - mainly this is about survival through the winter. So far, I'm quite pleased with it.\n0) It was well packed - plenty of padding and spacers to minimize banging around. Amazon had 2 guys to put it on my porch. No damage observed anywhere when I unpacked. All tools/screws/instructions present. Everything lined up fine for assembly.\n1) I was able to set it up myself (5'3\" 135lb 51F) because I'm impatient. But I also used a hand truck, sliding cloth for the wood floors, and careful use of leverage /tilting allowed me to set it up. YMMV. **make note of which side is the \"Heavy\" end (marked on the box) - that's the front, so you don't have to rotate it around last minute. And of course, which side should go \"up\".\n2) lubricating under the belt is awkward but essential. If I understood correctly, you're supposed to get all the way across under the belt. I dug out a clean paint stick, rag + rubber band to help with that, and used 2/3 of the bottle, trying to work as much up / down the track as possible.\n3) Track adjustment - I did make some tweaks - just took it very easy and walked on it for a bit. I probably did 4 tweaks, the last couple at 1/8 turn rather than 1/4 turn as recommended to dial it in. Just be patient and use it for a few min to let it settle in.\n4) Operation is easy, I like the buttons on the arms as well as on the console. The water bottle holders are minuscule, and there's no place to put my cellphone / nalgene. That's called out in other reviews, too. But for $340, I'll manage.\n4) Sound: very quiet if you're not walking/running. In use, you can hear the belt sliding and of course your lumbering footsteps on the running surface. Not too bad. I have cheap noise canceling earbuds and they work well enough so I can listen to an audio book.\nTBD how it does over the long run, but 3 days in - quiet satisfied!"

     "name": "How tall were Sinatra, Crosby and Bogie? 5'6\" to 5'8\", depending on your source. Regardless, this would suit any of them fine. But I'm a 6'1\" male, and therein lies the problem with this treadmill. The handle bars are considerably lower than the one it replaces--by my hips nstead of between my stomach and my chest. As a result, when I reach between 3 and 4 mph during a brisk half-hour walk, I'm not standing erect in a circumscribed tight circle but am leaning forward--and soon my legs are off the treadmill, banging against its hind side or the metal on either side.\nI don't recall any warning about height or indications that the handles were not height-adjustable. I guess I should have taken more seriously the audience--decidedly female--that this item was being pitched at. On the other hand, a young woman who stands 5'10\" said she finds the handles too low and the belt too short even for her. Maybe the length of the belt is an equally important factor, but I think handles with adjustable height might be sufficient to keep me in line.\nLater: I've adjusted to the low handle bars and put adhesive cycle tape over the plastic grips, which were excessively slippery from perspiration after the first 10 minutes. Also, I've taught myself to stand straighter with less reliance--or \"leaning\"--on the handle bars. For the money, this is a machine that should get the job done (my weight is 170 to 180). The programs are practically infinite in terms of speed and time, and the surface tilt can be raised and lowered--manually, but still with little difficulty. It's $200 less than the last treadmill I purchased from Amazon --ten years ago--and so quiet as to be noiseless (from my perspective--a complaint came from the lady on the floor below me--whatever she's hearing, I'm not!). I'm raising my rating to 4."

For example, I'll run for 20 minutes doing intervals between 6.0 and 7.5, and the distance won't even equal 2 miles. However, if I run for 20 minutes and stay at 6.0 the whole time, it tracks 2 miles.\n- I find it a bit too narrow for walking. I'm 5'5 and 125 lbs, with a fairly slender build, and I often hit my hands on the handrails while walking on it. This isn't a problem while running though, since my arms/hands stay above the handrails."

While I do appreciate the honesty of Amazon in that regard, I donât liked the fact that they didnât refund my money for next 24-48 hours.\nOrdered it a second time with a preferred room delivery. The delivery guys promptly delivered it to the exact place in my basement where I wanted it. Geez this thing was heavy. The installation was pretty easy..you just fit couple of screws and on your way.\nNow to the workings. Itâs a pretty basic treadmill..has a manual incline which I recommend to set per your comfortability before first use. Has a weird kind of bottle holder but fits okay. So far Iâve used it only upto speed 3 and has worked fine. However, the stopping of the belt isnât that smooth. It suddenly stops with a jerk which can shock you a bit especially after the workout.\nItâs not a very fancy treadmill so if your expectation is to use it for a brisk walk, youâll be fine.

One end of the box was a little squished but large pieces of styrofoam prevented any damage to the treadmill itself.\nAssembly was simple and I can't see it being any simpler. The only tool needed is the provided Allen wrench.\nYou remove one screw to remove some safety plate (the purpose of which is a mystery to me) then screw in 6 bolts at the bottom of the console/handlebar support, then add 2 more to keep the console/handlebars in place, then tighten two pre-installed screws. After that lubricate the belt, then run it and check the belt for alignment."

Luckily the set up didn't take too long because we had to pack it all up again to return it. We ordered a replacement and everything is fine. It works really well and I love that it is simple and small. It's so nice to be able to jump on it at random times to exercise, rather than plan something more involved."

I was able to successfully setup the treadmill myself and had used it on and off for few months. After about 4-5 months the Treadmill motor starting blowing the fuse of the room and I have been trying to reach sunny product support from them on. Sunny customer and tech support is the WORST I have seen, I am highly disappointed. I have raised 3 tickets on their site, left voice messages on their support phone, have tried to reach them on their support line daily and no luck in speaking to anyone at Sunny support team.\nSTAY AWAY FROM ANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS!!! if it breaks you are stuck with a machine that you cannot use and cannot return. SHAME ON THE SUPPORT TEAM FOR NOT RESPONDING TO ANY ISSUES."

     "name": "Great treadmill! Comparing to the ones you get at a fitness center, although smaller, this one definitely gets the job done. The assembly was pretty easy. The only thing that took forever was centering the belt. Other than that, I love my treadmill. I've already spent a couple days on it running/walking for 30 min each time. My daughter has also spent about 30 min on it as well. It fits in my 12Ã12 room with my Queen sized bed just fine."

I'm 68 yo so I don't do a whole lot of running but you can run on this baby. Manually inclines and has a nice soft fold up and down strut. Easy as pie to set manually or you can use any of the preset programs which you can make changes to. Belt is a little narrow but works for me. I'm 5'7\" @ 155 lbs. For the cost and features, this is hard to beat. Seems to be well made and was easy to assemble using the supplied 8 bolts. I even sprung for the ridiculously priced extended warranty. Manufacturer's product description is accurate."

Algo que no deberÃ­a suceder en una cita de correr nueva, tenÃ­a la opciÃ³n de devolverla pero es demasiado pesada para cargar con ella, asi que opte por quedarmela aunque sea para uso de ooco tiempo, esto es un riesgo que siempre puede ocurrir, hacer gastos costoso en productos que ya an sido usados por otras personas"

Great price for what you get which is a basic, no frills treadmill. I was able to assemble myself but I could see how someone with less strength abilities might not be able to. Had my husband help get it in the room and I unboxed and put together on my own. Most of it is already assembled. You just have to add handle and a few pieces at the bottom. Itâs getting it separated from the box that I struggled with. Iâm a petite woman and I was still able to do it, though. My only complaint would be the location of the handles in relation to how my arms move while I walk. I donât know if the handles on my old treadmill were just wider set, but I almost always hit my arm on it multiple times while I walk to warm up. Running is fine as my arms are moving differently. Obviously it wasnât a deal killer since I kept the machine, but just something to be aware of. Overall great purchase for my needs."

Now they are telling me I have to replace the control board too for 50 dollars. Customer support is terrible. You have to go back and forth in emails because they refuse to deal over the phone. When it does run the belt slips and i've tuned it according the the manual numerous times. As someone else stated the motor is terrible basically. I would never purchase this again.

Because of their manufacturing warranty, they actually ended up sending me a new machine. They were so helpful when I contacted them! They took the time to explain to me what I needed to send them information on, walked me through every step, and were very patient even though I have such difficulty hearing. While all of them were great, Victoria T. was absolutely delightful.

Iâm hoping that Sunny can send a replacement cover for the broken part. It really is just a plastic co er of all the mechanics.

The parts all fit correctly. The console holds a water bottle or iPhone. The pause mode is a good feature other treads in this price range often do not have.

If you are an outdoor runner but need to run some maintenance miles indoors when its cold (i.e. Chicago) a few times a week over the winter and dont have a lot of space, give it a go.

Literally 6 screws, and that is really only for the hand bars and display. I was unsure of how to gauge the mph, but for reference, I am completely new to running/jogging. 3mph is a fast walk for me, 4.5-5mph is a brisk jog, and 6mph or more is a full on run for me. It goes up to 9mph but I wasn't brave enough to temp my fate. It's not heavy and it is easy to move around. It is extremely easy to use. It has quick speed buttons of 2, 4, and 6 mph, but you can also fine tune it in increments of .1 mph with convenient buttons on the handles. The only very minor flaw I would say is that the incline options are very subtle. They do increase the difficult but not by a lot. Overall my wife and I are extremely pleased with this product, and compared to the prices of some other treadmills this was an excellent value. I highly recommend this product."

Its a manually adjusted incline- just to keep in mind if that is important to you. The cup holders are small too. They do not fit my water bottle nor phone very well (see pictured: I have an iPhone 5 in an otter box case). But it can hold a small water bottle .

The features of the treadmill are okay, the belt runs fine and the speeds are sufficient for my casual/exercise needs.

It was heavy for sure but I am 5'1 135 lbs and I was able to get it done by myself. Only about 6 bolts to put in, otherwise is pretty much pre-assembled. Very easy to figure out even without the instructions it was pretty basic common sense. I have used it a few times already and had no issues. I am using for walking/jogging. Also very easy to fold and unfold for storage. All in all I've had the product for about a week and am very satisfied that it is exactly as advertised!\nUpdate: going on almost 4 months of using the treadmill and still.no complaints! Great value!!\nUpdate: 2.5 years still happy with my purchase! I ended up losing thr safety key which makes the treadmill useless but contacted their customer support and they were super responsive and helpful! The new key was shipped out and I'm back up and running ;)"

     "name": "Sunny Health and Fitness makes one of the better packaged cheap treadmills on the market. The refinement of the look reminds us of the look of several units we started seeing in Wal Mart stores years ago. We bought another Sunny Health and Fitness treadmill last year and pointed out some of the shortcomings of that treadmill, especially in the safety department and as far as we can tell, the apple hasn't fallen far from the tree with the SF-T7603.\nAs you can see in the first photo, this treadmill has very smart, good looking packaging in regard to fit and finish and the ergonomics of the machine. The horror story comes alive when you remove the motor cover and look under the hood. The motor is shown as a 2.2 HP \"peak rated\" motor which is just smoke and mirrors because there is no accepted standard for rating \"peak HP\" in the treadmill world. I've been repairing treadmills for over 30 years and the only accepted standard is the NEMA definition of continuous duty. If this motor were exposed to that standard, this would be a fractional HP motor which means it has far less than 1 HP if rated on an accurate scale.\nSome of the clues to their trickery, as you can see in the second photo, is they are using the numbers to \"game the system\" by showing the rating at 18 amps which a normal household outlet will have trouble maintaining and the high RPM figure of 5400 RPM's. The reason I say these are clues is that in rating all DC motors, the formula gives you a higher rating with the more amps and RPM's that you use so if you can inflate these numbers artificially, you can justify putting a higher rating on the motor than what it will actually achieve in regular use.\nThe mechanical system of this treadmill is another clue to the horror that lies within. When you measure the friction coefficient between the belt and deck, you find that these aren't nearly as freely moving as some of the other cheap machines on the market, notably those from Icon, the biggest producer of fitness equipment in the world. What this will do is eventually cause the motor to overheat, the controller, shown in the third photo, to overheat, and the heat build up between the belt and deck will wear out the drive system prematurely.\nThe good thing about this machine is the simple design and the console, which is shown in the fourth photo. This is a very simple and easy to read console and from both of the Sunny Health and Fitness treadmills we have bought in the past year, we have had no troubles from the console portion of the machine. Hopefully you won't have a problem with this part of the machine.\nOverall, if I were buying in this price range I would go with an Icon make which is made under the brand names Weslo and Gold's Gym but even these machines have some incredibly serious shortcomings. It is like having the best house in the worst neighborhood."

However, looking at the reviews of those under this dollar amount, I was disappointed as most received a three and one-half star rating. Almost all the reviews spoke of receiving damaged equipment and short life spans. I recently noticed that the Sunny Health and Fitness treadmill received a very high rating for such an economical unit. I decided to try it and must say that (1) it was delivered well packed and with no damage, (2) I cannot imagine another treadmill being easier to assemble than the Sunny. I had it unpacked, assembled, and running in less than 1 hour, (3) it is very quiet (which is astounding for an economical unit), and all features worked as advertised. If this treadmill proves to be reliable and long lived, it must definitely be a first choice among treadmills costing less than $1000. Thus far, I am completely satisfied and feel I have made a good investment."

     "name": "Nothing but perfect!\nI recently ordered this machine and I must say it really feels nice buying a treadmill that's sturdy, compact and fits right on the pocket. It has all the basic functions that you can expect from a treadmill and any more expectations are just excuses for you not doing your cardio religiously.\nNow, having said that this treadmill is really not for guys who are huge and have a beast like posture weighing 250+ lbs and 6 and above tall.. Nadaa....\nI have an athletic physique and I am 5' 7\" and I can easitly walk, jog and run at 6-8mph speed on this treadmill. This is perhaps the most easy-to-setup treadmill and it took me just 15 min from unpacking to getting the last screw on. Remember to put the oil before you jump on it and if possible buy the one that has a long neck tube (not the one that comes with the machine). It's just easier to reach on all side of the carpet.\nOverall - I am not much into writing reviews and I am a big critic of any product I purchase from Amazon. This one really deserved it's reviews as I can't even remember how long have I been evaluating treadmills on Amazon and comparing the pros n cons of each other. FINALLY! I AM A HAPPY CAMPER :)"

     "name": "Assembly - I was very pleased with how easy this treadmill was to assemble. It was literally just six bolts. However I did make a big mistake. I didn't discover the cross bar beam until after I had moved the treadmill to its permanent location. So I had to undo a couple of bolts to get the cross being into the holes and secure it. This made the entire console much more sturdy and it already was. I assembled the treadmill to its upright position by myself with no help. If you are just a little handy, then you should have no problems assembling this. But I uploaded a video which does not include the crossbar being installed. So don't make the most same mistake I did. Hopefully my video will help somebody assemble treadmill faster when they receive it.\nFunction- I've had the treadmill for more than 2 weeks now, in fact almost 3 weeks. I've used it almost daily. I have tried some of the pre-programs that it came with but mostly I just use the quick buttons to get to my desired speed which is 5 mph. I treadmill is a little longer than another treadmill that I have. It is also a very quiet and smooth treadmill even when jogging on it. I also set the incline to 5Â°. I love that it has quick buttons on both of the handles as well. The console is very sturdy and can hold a cell phone or tablet. The speakers on the console are not the loudest and are the same as my other treadmill.\nThey treadmill folds up really nicely and folds down very easily. It also has wheels in case you want to move it around when done and store it. I am just keeping mine in a permanent position in the garage. It is really deep cup holders which are nice for my water bottles. I purchased a small little battery operated fan which sits on the console and pulls me down. This is a really good mid-ranged treadmill with a lot of presets in it. And if you have a tablet the retractable holder is another nice feature that my other treadmill does not have. The longer tread on this treadmill versus my other one also makes me feel a little more secure on it. Couple of things that this treadmill is lacking which my other treadmill is also lacking is that the USB port does not charge. Not a deal-breaker but that would have been nice if I could charge my cell phone or tablet from the console. Also the calorie counter on this and speed seem to be a little generous compared to my other treadmill. But I really don't use these because I have a Garmin fit watch it tracks my fitness and heart rate. So the most important thing and features on this treadmill are the time counter which is important because I do 45 minutes on it every morning and 45 minutes every evening. I've gotten in a lot better shape and can really push the incline and speed on this treadmill. I have also lost a lot of belly flat this past 3 weeks thanks to this treadmill. In summary I definitely recommend this treadmill especially at this price point. It's great deal and it's very smooth and quiet."

     "name": "Was really excited to get this treadmill. It was super easy to put together, however, it came with a few washers but no instructions on which screws they went to. The programming is easy once you figure out the instructions. I also love the fact that it has ports so that you can play your music through the speakers! The only cons my husband and I have noticed so far is that there is a squeak when he is running. We think this is just due to him weighing more, but it is a little annoying. The other con is that the incline goes up to a 15, but the actual incline isn't much. Overall we are happy with this purchase!"
    },
    {
     "name": "This treadmill was a great choice. It was very easy to assemble, with just 3 steps and clear instructions. It features great programs, yet is very simple to use. It is very quiet. The soft drop system is amazing, I haven't seen something like that before. It makes lowering and lifting up the deck so much easier.\nI've used this almost every day since I got it, and I'd definately recommend it to others."

    {
     "name": "First, I bought this and it arrived at my house shattered in pieces like the box had exploded. What a nightmare getting a return scheduled for this thing, which I had to lug in pieces into my house in the pouring rain while I waited the few days it took to get a pickup for the return. But, amazon is awesome and they made it as easy as they could. I was still so set on this particular one, that I went ahead and ordered a new one. Second one also arrived with a banged up box and with lots of plastic pieces broken. But this time, it still functioned, thank goodness. Now the machine. Whoever engineered this should think about a career change. There is no Bluetooth as advertised, instead there is an mp3 jack. See image. There is a start/ stop button on the hand rest, exactly where you would happen to rest a hand which SUCKS to accidentally press while youâre in the middle of a run and it is extremely easy to accidentally do! See image. Also, the two hand rests are strangely narrow and an I've never had a problem with whacking my hands/ arms on any other treadmill but I have that issue here. The pulse rate doesnât work... every time I use it, it bounces from 79-82 while my apple watch shows 160. Thatâs not just a little off. Also, it sounds like itâs going to break when I run in it. Iâve tried to ensure all is level and nothing is loose, but it sounds like itâs going to snap with every step I take (reassuring, eh?) Otherwise the speed and elevation work, but Iâm not sure how accurate they are. They seem ok."

    {
     "name": "I was hesitant when the box arrived because it was half open and all tore up but the delivery guy just left it so I decided to open it. All was well inside and the treadmill was easy to put together.\nIt works well for our family. My husband and I are both over 220 and we can walk/jog on it just fine with no issues. We use it 4-5 times a week each. My 14 year old son runs on it at max incline at 8-9 mph for an hour and it works great for him too.\nIt fits nicely in our spare room and has become the preferred price of work out equipment for our family. Itâs not a top of the line treadmill, but it is more than capable of satisfying our familyâs needs.\nThe only negative is the placement of the on/off switch. It is on the handle and we have all accidentally bumped it while working out and turned the machine off. No a fatal flaw, but frustrating if you are in a rhythm.\nOverall, I would recommend based on our experience."

    {
     "name": "Basic but excellent. Great for basic home workouts. If you are just looking to walk or incline walk, maybe light jog then this works great. If you are looking to run fast or are a heavy stepper, or are looking for top of the line bells and whistles,this is not for you. Speakers sound like walkman speakers and the area to run is minimal. Even though it folds it still takes up some room in an awkward kind of way. Its wayyyy better than cheaper models, but if you want more options or a solid look ,spend some more money on a better model.\nIf you have a spare room and like to walk or very lightly jog, or even just incline walk then this thing is great for that!"

    {
     "name": "The package arrived without any issue (I saw other complained about packaging). There is no good enough packaging to prevent careless handle. It was very easy to assemble from the instruction. I was please with the mobility of the equipment as I had to move and it went without a hitch. The incliner mechanism is smooth and silent. The controls are simple, well it has only a handle full of programs to select from. We just use the manual speed and incliner controls to make the training more or less challenging. Overall a good machine for homes with limited space."

I wasnât sure how accessible it would be for me as a blind user but it has buttons that are easy to use. I also like that it has an app to track my distance. My husband and I both use the treadmill. We have not been able to figure out how to use the speakers with Bluetooth yet but that is not very important for me to use since I regularly have my phone with me anyways on the treadmill. This is a great treadmill for anyone that is looking for a simple treadmill that is easy to use."

     "name": "Very pleased with this treadmill. It has some good features and is easy to use and set up. I highly recommended it!\nWhen I received the box it was in poor condition (thanks FedEx). After getting the treadmill put together I found two broken plastic pieces that fit in the end of the treadmill. I contacted the seller and they were very helpful. They gave me some money back and shipped the (easily replaceable) plastic pieces to me. However, they did initially ship those pieces to the wrong address/state. Once I informed them of their mistake they quickly shipped the pieces back out. My wife and I are very pleased with their service."

    {
     "name": "This treadmill is great quality for the price. I had someone come and assemble it so I can't speak to how easy that is but it works just fine. It does make noise and is a little creaky when I speed up or adjust the incline but it's nothing too bothersome. I can't even hear it over my headphones when they're turned up so that should give you some insight into how loud it is.\nIf you're on the fence, I definitely say go for it. As someone who is easily disappointed and satisfied, I'd recommend this -- just be realistic that this is not anywhere near compared to a gym-level treadmill. It's just a nice, little piece of equipment you can use here and there.\nFull disclosure: I've used it maybe twenty times so I can't speak to how sturdy it is for long-term use."

Nice and easy quick speed and incline buttons. Has quite of few of programmed workouts. Simplicity in this model is what i like. So far so good."

Initially had few challenges to know how to use built-in Bluetooth but managed it from online resources.\nIts gives same feeling as the one I use in public gym no difference in the different preset modes . Lot more option for weight loss , cardio and trekking. Compact to fit your room. Weight is average to carry . East to assemble . I did it in 30 mins by reading the manual. Good quality.\nI recommend buying this product."

They did send a little bottle of a lubricant but it didn't have any labels on it.

When increased speed, it shakes/ moves very easily. I donât like that you cannot pause your progress. Stopping is the only option and once you do, all calories/ distance is lost. The other disadvantage Iâve found is the length of platform. My stride tends to be long and I have to be cautious not to step on the end of it when using."

The digital panel looks like it was owned previously as the USB port looks worn.\nIt was easy to assemble, and works good. Best feature is its sturdy and folds up nice.\nOverall experience was poor."

Complete waste of time, energy and effort.\n*Update: This has been the worse purchase experience on Amazon for me. The customer service from Amazon themselves was especially dreadful and terrible. It has truly been an ordeal. I will most likely cancel my Prime membership after this experience."

I have bruises on the top of my hands from hitting the side rails regulary.\n2) The instructions are minimal and not well translated to English.\nOther than that, I highly recommend this as a quality treadmill at an affordable price."

You're better off spending another $1000 and getting something that will last you more than 8 months or about 40 slow walks. Also if you try actually running on it, it feels like its going to break down the middle. I do not recommend this product."

The only cons my husband and I have noticed so far is that there is a squeak when he is running. We think this is just due to him weighing more, but it is a little annoying. The other con is that the incline goes up to a 15, but the actual incline isn't much. Overall we are happy with this purchase!"

     "name": "First, I bought this and it arrived at my house shattered in pieces like the box had exploded. What a nightmare getting a return scheduled for this thing, which I had to lug in pieces into my house in the pouring rain while I waited the few days it took to get a pickup for the return. But, amazon is awesome and they made it as easy as they could. I was still so set on this particular one, that I went ahead and ordered a new one. Second one also arrived with a banged up box and with lots of plastic pieces broken. But this time, it still functioned, thank goodness. Now the machine. Whoever engineered this should think about a career change. There is no Bluetooth as advertised, instead there is an mp3 jack. See image. There is a start/ stop button on the hand rest, exactly where you would happen to rest a hand which SUCKS to accidentally press while youâre in the middle of a run and it is extremely easy to accidentally do! See image. Also, the two hand rests are strangely narrow and an I've never had a problem with whacking my hands/ arms on any other treadmill but I have that issue here. The pulse rate doesnât work... every time I use it, it bounces from 79-82 while my apple watch shows 160. Thatâs not just a little off. Also, it sounds like itâs going to break when I run in it. Iâve tried to ensure all is level and nothing is loose, but it sounds like itâs going to snap with every step I take (reassuring, eh?) Otherwise the speed and elevation work, but Iâm not sure how accurate they are. They seem ok."
    },
    {
     "name": "I was hesitant when the box arrived because it was half open and all tore up but the delivery guy just left it so I decided to open it. All was well inside and the treadmill was easy to put together.\nIt works well for our family. My husband and I are both over 220 and we can walk/jog on it just fine with no issues. We use it 4-5 times a week each. My 14 year old son runs on it at max incline at 8-9 mph for an hour and it works great for him too.\nIt fits nicely in our spare room and has become the preferred price of work out equipment for our family. Itâs not a top of the line treadmill, but it is more than capable of satisfying our familyâs needs.\nThe only negative is the placement of the on/off switch. It is on the handle and we have all accidentally bumped it while working out and turned the machine off. No a fatal flaw, but frustrating if you are in a rhythm.\nOverall, I would recommend based on our experience."
    },
    {
     "name": "Basic but excellent. Great for basic home workouts. If you are just looking to walk or incline walk, maybe light jog then this works great. If you are looking to run fast or are a heavy stepper, or are looking for top of the line bells and whistles,this is not for you. Speakers sound like walkman speakers and the area to run is minimal. Even though it folds it still takes up some room in an awkward kind of way. Its wayyyy better than cheaper models, but if you want more options or a solid look ,spend some more money on a better model.\nIf you have a spare room and like to walk or very lightly jog, or even just incline walk then this thing is great for that!"

It was very easy to assemble from the instruction. I was please with the mobility of the equipment as I had to move and it went without a hitch. The incliner mechanism is smooth and silent. The controls are simple, well it has only a handle full of programs to select from. We just use the manual speed and incliner controls to make the training more or less challenging. Overall a good machine for homes with limited space."

My husband and I both use the treadmill. We have not been able to figure out how to use the speakers with Bluetooth yet but that is not very important for me to use since I regularly have my phone with me anyways on the treadmill.

After getting the treadmill put together I found two broken plastic pieces that fit in the end of the treadmill. I contacted the seller and they were very helpful. They gave me some money back and shipped the (easily replaceable) plastic pieces to me. However, they did initially ship those pieces to the wrong address/state. Once I informed them of their mistake they quickly shipped the pieces back out. My wife and I are very pleased with their service."

     "name": "This treadmill is great quality for the price. I had someone come and assemble it so I can't speak to how easy that is but it works just fine. It does make noise and is a little creaky when I speed up or adjust the incline but it's nothing too bothersome. I can't even hear it over my headphones when they're turned up so that should give you some insight into how loud it is.\nIf you're on the fence, I definitely say go for it. As someone who is easily disappointed and satisfied, I'd recommend this -- just be realistic that this is not anywhere near compared to a gym-level treadmill. It's just a nice, little piece of equipment you can use here and there.\nFull disclosure: I've used it maybe twenty times so I can't speak to how sturdy it is for long-term use."

I just keep it folded up.\nThe walking pad itself is very good. With covid, i haven't been going out as much and i take about 30 minute walks on this thing. It's nice when its too cold/too hot or when it's raining. I haven't had any trouble and everything is working as expected.\nThe remote is pretty cool too. You can control everything with the remote. However, you do need to have a small stand/small table nearby to place it on when you're walking. Otherwise you'll be holding it the entire time.\nOverall, for the price and space savings, i can't complain.

A lot are not very good until you get over that mark (like 1.2k +) but this one does ok, just a couple things to consider:\nPros,\n-Has auto incline feature. A lot of lower models do not. there is either no incline or you have to manually set it. I like changing my incline as I go.\n-Display screen shows speed/time/distance/level/calories at same time. So you don't have to push buttons or wait for it to cycle through.\n-I'm taller and it holds my stride.\n-Easy to lift up and down.\n-Pretty quiet.\nMid\n-Its more compact than some (good) but its more compact than some (bad) because if you are a little 'bigger' or your walking balance goes from side to side, you can hit sides quicker which could be dangerous. After a time or two I adjusted and like the smaller size due to room constraints.\n-Yes, it has quick touch buttons, but the incline is by 3 degrees (3,6,9 etc) and the speed is by 2. It would be great -if you could either program them or just have single degrees. I assume they did this to save money and still claim these features.\n-Pulse meter does ok.\nCons,\n-The calorie count is not correct and no way to adjust. I finally had to calibrate based on my Fitbit and the treadmill calorie show is about 2.6 times LESS than Fitbit. Good to know...\n-The music feature is not worth it at all. it sounds worse than just playing your phone speaker. I wish it did work as I like having the controls right there, but its dead weight. Just have Alexa close by.\n-Due to the compact size, the handrail positions are easy to hit with your swinging arms. Again I had to learn to keep mine close so as not to beat myself up.\n-Not really a deal-breaker, but the silver gives it a more cheap look. It thought about covering it with some type of vinal, but nagh.\nSo bottom line: not your gym's treadmill, but for a decent smaller unit that auto inclines and gets you your workout, this works."

This treadmill feels solid, has a decently wide belt, and best of all incline.\nMy one concern with buying a cheaper treadmill is how long it would last, and three months in that fear was realized. However, I need not have worried. Sunny Fitness has outstanding customer service. They worked with me to get it back up and running at no cost to me. All I had to do was reach out and they were very proactive in troubleshooting the issue."

     "name": "After doing my homework on a couple of different treadmills for my home... i chose this one. (Keeping in mind a few important points: cost, size, incline capability, sturdiness and of course reviews) I believe this was the best one in my $500 or less budget and it has been great so far. Pretty cool that you can plug in ur phone via aux port and have your music playing thru the speakers...& the handle controls are super convenient!\nThe set up was fairly easy... my fiance set it up by himself in less than an hour. Heâs not a big muscley guy either (6â2, 180lbs). Iâve been using it for about 2 months now....& so far so good! I am 5â4 and 180lbs and it works perfectly! I do mostly fast paced walking but i also jog on it... and it feels sturdy enough when i do run a little harder. The arms placed at a pretty good height and width. you definitely have enough room to swing your arms a bit.\nThe only thing that bothers me a little is that when i walk on incline.... it creaks. i have my headphones on usually so its okay... no big deal.\nOverall im am pretty pleased with my purchase. i gave it 4 stars because of the creaking.... maybe because its new and is getting âbroken inâ but ill update my review in a few months."

I don't think it's unreasonable to expect that if you buy a product it will work.

Extremely disappointed, especially given how hard this product was to lug up to my second floor."

     "name": "Arrived quickly but wow this this is HEAVY. Almost 150 lbs I feel sorry for the shipping carrier, I don't know how they got it on my porch but the box was still in fairly good condition. It was packaged pretty well and there was no damage. Getting it out of the box was hard and will be ideal with at least two people, but once it is out is is pretty easy to put together. The thing is already assembled really all you have to do is pull the arms and control panel up and bolt it in, and bolt the control panel into the upright position. Seems really sturdy and I imagine it should hold up well.\nMy wife and I have only used it once so far, I'm 5' 11\" and 175 lbs and she is 5' 0\" and 210 lbs and it seems fairly comfortable for both of us. Although her arms are more bent holding the handles where mine are pretty much straight. The incline works great although it is quite slow to go up and down but that is ok. I thought the max 8 MPH was going to be too slow but it actually isn't... 4 MPH is a decent jog for me and really all that I want out of it so I imagine 8 MPH should be more than enough for most people.\nThe only thing I don't like so far is the speakers for playing music. I thought they sounded really tiny.\nOverall though we are pretty happy. I hope the thing will last. I will absolutely post back if I have any problems with it."

Email sent to support got a reply many days later, and it was for me to check to make sure all wires are connected properly.\nI order this so that the whole family can exercise during the stay at home order.

    {
     "name": "I waited a good month before writing this review.\nI have been using the treadmill almost daily since I bought it and by and large the experience has been positive. The treadmill does not boast of many bells and whistles and itâs price reflects that. It works as promised and helps me sweat it out in the comforts of my home. Itâs motor is not very powerful and itâs running board feels a bit narrow even for a medium built person like me. But no complaints on those counts as it was a conscious decision on my part to buy a treadmill with the advertised specs.\nThere are some irritants, though. For one, the running belt keeps gravitating to one side or the other so much so that I see myself trying to correct it almost on a daily basis. I called the company and the person on the phone did try her best to help me out but I think she also did not have much of a clue. Probably because of my daily tinkering to ensure belt alignment the belt has become a little loose and it tends to stall when running at low speeds.\nSecondly, I wish they had speed and incline buttons with increments of 1 instead of 2 (for speed) and 3% (for incline) respectively. Then there are these pre-set programs and 3 customizable workout options. I find none of the speed/distance combinations in the preset programs is of my choice. And the customizable programs take ages to get set up and even then you may not like what you end up with. Much better to go with a simple phone app.\nFinally, the dashboard is pretty small - if you keep anything bigger than a phone on it, all the dashboard information gets obstructed.\nSo was it a bad purchase? No. Should I have paid a bit more and bought a bigger - size and motor capacity - treadmill? Yeah, for sure."

     "name": "I bought this to battle the \"Fifteen from Quarantine\". It was high time I did some sort of exercising, so I searched high and low for a used treadmill to get me going, but I couldn't find one that was decent for less than this cost. I'm so glad. I really love this thing. It's SO easy to adjust your speed, I love the mileage tracker AND the timer. I can track my progress to see how long it takes me to walk a mile today as opposed to a week ago (shaved 2 minutes off!). I'm not in good enough shape yet to use the incline, well at least not the \"real\" incline. At level one, you can barely notice it, you have to go up to about level 4 to feel it. I plan to wait a bit before I do that. I've been walking between 1.5 and 2 miles on this almost daily for the last 5 weeks and haven't had a single problem with the machine. It feels solid, it's got cup holders on either side (one holds my drink, the other my hand weight). I haven't used the speaker yet because I prefer headphones. All in all, a VERY good purchase. It got me off the couch, and that's praise from on high, lemme tell ya."

     "name": "I purchased mine back in June to exercise while working from home. It was pretty easy to assemble but I get electrical shocks from day one. The manual provides step by step to check what can be wrong, which I did, but nothing worked. Manual says to make sure the homeâs outlets are properly grounded. So I had an electrician come over to my house to make sure everything was fine and he said it was.\nAt this point I started contacting Sunny Customer Service. Sometimes I had to email them 3 times over the course of 10 days to get a response. They provide poor information. When I am finally tired of waiting for a response to my emails I call them. They requested pictures of the motor and control panel to check if it was defective. When they finally responded, they suggested that I try things that âcustomers sometimes tryâ to apply fabric softener on the belt and anti-static spray. I called back their customer service. They said they have more calls and emails that they can handle right now so it takes quite some time to get a response. They promised to escalate my issue but even worse - they said their warranty DOESNT include the option of sending a technician to peopleâs houses. They can only provide guidance via email / phone.\nIn a nutshell, this is not worth your time and money. My stress just goes up every time I use it.\nAs far as my escalated ticket, I am still waiting for their response.\nI should have spent a little more and bought a product of better quality. Stay away!"

     "name": "I saw where other people had problems with assembly needing 2 people. I did not find that. The only time I needed another person was to lift it out of the bottom part of the shipping box. I later realized that with a box cutter, I could have just cut the edges of either end of the box and rolled it out since the back of the belt platform has wheels. But assembly was easy with just a few bolts to screw in place, two covers to screw into place where the uprights meet the base. Easy peasy. I found the \"fold down\" just needed me to keep my foot on the shock absorber and gently give the base a little urging to fold down and then it took over. It has the heart rate monitor, plenty of speeds for me and enough inclines to get this old body huffying and puffing. Timer, distance and calories burned which are never enough for the effort I find. It's solid. Apparently you can plug in a music machine of some kind but I use it in a room with a TV and radio so I don't need that. The bottom construction and raised bars for the control panel are solid. Moving it around takes a little getting used to to get it to tilt back and roll on its rollers. This might be where you need someone to help steady the unit if you are not especially strong. Now I only just set it up today, checked every function over and did a bit of a walk at different speeds and inclines so I cannot attest to its durability over time. So only time will tell. I expect to use it every day or my 35 minutes walk with cool down and my wife sill do the same. Definitely order an extra bottle of lubricant. The one small bottle that came with it was just enough to get it started but had nothing left after application. Seems to be a good solid unit and after reading all the problems with the closest competitor the Nordic track that sells for $100 more and discovered the support problems then reading how most people with this one enjoyed good support, I am happy with my decision to buy."

     "name": "When I started looking for a replacement treadmill, I suddenly realized how nice my old one was. The Sunny Health & Fitness SF-T7515 Smart Treadmill with Auto Incline was the closest replacement I could find for a reasonable price. I struggle coming to terms paying hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars for a product that is basically a motor with a belt that goes around in a circle. The price justification seems to be driven by size of the motor and walk belt, as well as add-on features such as auto-incline, and built-in electronics, connectivity and monitoring. This product seems to do everything it claims pretty well. However, I'm surprised by the absence of a couple of things. First, I'm driven by a daily goal of at least 10,000 steps. The electronics on this treadmill measure time, distance, calories burned, and even heartrate....but not the number of steps. This is a feature that I miss from my old treadmill. The other thing that is truly surprising is, Sunny provides no process for registering the purchase of their products. Almost every manufacturer asks buyers to register their purchase, no matter how inexpensive. I am concerned that Sunny has no documentation regarding my somewhat sizable purchase. It has electronics and motorized parts that can be subject to failure. Since Sunny has no information regarding this purchase, I'm concerned what level of support I will receive, if any, if there is a problem in the future."

I think this would be a great treadmill for a smaller space because itâs pretty narrow. The belt itself is 16.5 inches wide, and the entire machine is a little over 28 inches at its widest point.\nPROS\nQuiet\nThe distance seems accurate\nSturdy\nGreat incline\nScreen is backlit\nEasy to assemble\nThe clock resets at 99:59, which I think is standard, but the belt will keep going and the your distance will continue to track. I thought this was cool. My old treadmill would just shut off at 99:59.\nCONS\nSpeakers sound pretty bad (this wasnât really important to me since I always use headphones anyway)\nSeems like the pulse is off- it read a lot lower than my Fitbit\nI usually run on the treadmill 4-5x per week so as long as it holds up, Iâm happy with it!"

     "name": "I also would NOT get a treadmill without auto incline. Doing it manually means getting off the treadmill and manually adjusting a plastic piece at the rear of the treadmill.\nBelt width on this treadmill is 16.5\", length is 49.5\". I'm 5' 10\" and if not careful (and my feet move towards the rear of the treadmill a little). I can feel where the belt is joined. Staying a little forward avoids that.\nVery easy to assemble comprising 6 bolts with lock washers and 4 screws. Their screw driver isn't much good, I would use your own. They provide two allen wrenches of slightly different sizes but only one size is needed.\nThe treadmill appears very sturdy, easy to fold up, easy to let down again. Bluetoothj speakers work OK to my Android phone. Not great speakers but wouldn't expect them to be great (after all, it is a treadmill). The speakers are certainly listenable to.\nThe treadmill motor is very quiet also.\nI did purchase the mat by Sunny that the treadmill sits on.\nPer the instructions, I did lube under the belt before use. Probably worth ordering more when you order the treadmill. Using more than 5 hours per week...they recommend lubing monthly.\nAll in all, a very good treadmill (not that I am any expert <g>).\nUpdate 2/21/2021\nIâve used this for the last several weeks now. I really like the treadmill. Seems to be well made, was well packed. The only very minor gripe I have is that between my phone volume control and the volume control on the treadmill it is a little difficult to get the volume just right. Either a little too soft or a little too loud. Not a big deal. The treadmill really needs a more granular volume control.\nUpdate 2/27/2021\nI don't take any stock in the pulse readings. I see wildly fluctuating numbers given during various times during my walking sessions. I walk 2.5 miles at 3.5mph 6 times per week. I see pulse fluctuations from the 80/90 mark after, say 1 mile, and release my fingers or thumbs from the handles. 20 or 30 seconds later, when testing again, I see figures in the 120/130 range and once as high as 170. 20 or seconds later it is back to 80/90. Doesn't make sense to me.\nUpdate 4/1/2021\nI sent an email to the manufacturer about 4 weeks ago. I had an observation about the display showing \"Fat\" and the manual showing \"BMI\" as well as asking a question about programming custom treadmill programs. As of today, I have had NO REPLY. Makes me wonder what would happen if I had a warranty claim (I don't ATM). Still not a good indication of support from the company. Lowering the rating to 3* due to this."

While certainly not as wide as a standard gym treadmill, the 16 1/2\" belt is comfortable to run on and the long tread is very nice. I have a medium frame (5'5\", 150 lbs) and was always comfortably in the middle of the track.\nIt was as easy to assemble as other reviews indicate. I was able to assemble it myself in less than an hour. All that's required is to lift the console and screw into place. It also comes with belt lube, which is nice and kept me from having to make a separate purchase. I will say that while it folds easily, it's heavier to move than I expected. I was comparing to a much smaller, cheaper treadmill and the difference is pretty obvious. It won't fit through my smaller bedroom doorways without some maneuvering but I'm sure I could make it happen if I tried hard enough.\nI am a medium user - I run 3-4 days a week for 45 minutes to an hour at a time. I tend to move between 3.5 and 6 on the speed scale and a 2 on the incline. The treadmill feels very stable and solid. Footfalls don't make excessive noise and I was able to hear the tv easily while jogging. Towards the end of my first jog, I did notice a squeak somewhere in the undercarriage on foot strike but I'm hoping that will clear up.\nI was nervous about buying something as big as a treadmill from Amazon but all in all, super satisfied with the product and very worth the price."

He ran me thru an electrical diagnostic check which showed a bad controller circuit board ! Since I dread an attempt to repack this thing and return it to Amazon, I have opted for a parts replacement, but they are not sure how long it will be, so I may be forced to return it to Amazon anyway.

I thought I might have to use it just for walking, not for running, but I was wrong. Sometimes a cheaper treadmill isn't comfortable for running. It was super easy to put together, but you def need more than one person. It's VERY heavy and you need someone to hold up the top part while someone else screws in pieces. I love that there is incline. I love there are a lot of different levels. These were important factors in my choice. Things to know: it's not quiet. Most treadmills are not. It's not louder than others but just be aware it's not quiet. And it's narrow. If you are very wide this is probably not for you. There is a max weight of 250 and it's more narrow than say, a gym treadmill. The good news about that is that it is a space saver! It's very sturdy. I'm happy with it."

It's pretty heavy-we moved it with those slidy \"moving-men\" thingies. Got it together, plugged it in, oiled the tread and the rails, per the instruction booklet. When we tried it for the first time, we noticed a squeak in the right rear of the machine. Tried some more oil, but the squeak continued. I contacted customer service via their website, and explained that there was an annoying squeak that make the machine unuseable, and could they point me in the right direction. They answered back that they needed the model number, which I'd given them in my e-mail, the serial number, with no indication where I might find that. The Order Number, which I told them I did not know, as there was no packing slip included in the shipment. They needed my phone number (why??), the purchase documents (there were none) and a video of the problem. Hard to video a squeak. My point being, if I have one of their products, and ask a very simple question, they should be able to answer it without my providing anything but the model number and a description of the problem. They should want to keep their customer base happy and it costs them NOTHING to answer back to try this or try that.

Feels as though I'm sliding off the hand grips. But I think does tend to make me grip harder and thereby work on my forearm muscles. Oiling the track also is a bit cumbersome.

I am 68 and like to hold on when I do 3.0 because I tend to sway to the side if not holding on and I use the incline raising it up 1 level every minute and then down every minute. I wish there was more room on the handle to hold on to other than the pulse meter. I seem to only be able to hold on at the very end unless I want the pulse staying on the whole time. I can see why some reviews say that if you put a book or tablet to look at you won't see the screen but I don't do anything but watch my screen because I time my inclines.

It was simple to put together and a pretty small sized treadmill, but perfect for me. My only complaint, this is probably just a me issue, is the rails on the sides are short, so when I get to swinging my arms when walking fast, I tend to wack my hand on the edges. I added some foam to stop this so hopefully that helps. Again I don't know if that is a design flaw or just a my own body design flaw. This has happened to me on other treadmills with short rails.

I use it for walking 4 to 5 times a week. I absolutely LOVE the auto incline feature. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because 5 star reviews can seem fishy, and also because the preset workouts are terrible. They go from a slow walk to running from a crazed dog in a flash with nothing in between.

It has rollers so it can be moved while it is folded, do not get the idea this a lighter weight portable treadmill it is not. It is easy to fold, and unfold with the hands off \"slow\" drop, once started it will unfold on it's own, it will not crash to the floor. It even looks nice. It came well packed, and in good shape with nothing broken, wonky, or missing. It took longer to read the instructions than it did to assemble it. Yes...it can be assembled by one person. It comes with a 1oz bottle of silicon oil for lubricating the running belt and the running board. Watch a few YouTube videos on oiling the belt and board. Also buy a larger bottle of silicon oil you will need it eventually. I have not had any problems with the belt or the motor. OH!...It really is quiet/silent!"

It's pretty easy to use, but I haven't bothered with the speakers or phone functions, so no comment on that. I selected this because it has the auto incline and great ratings, so far I'm not disappointed! I'm putting together a home office in my basement and LOVE being able to get in a quick walk or run throughout the day while I'm working...it's truly been life changing!"

     "name": "Since the gym is not an option during Covid, I bought this treadmill. It looked like a great deal...big mistake! I mainly used it for walking for about 30 min, 5 days a week. It was fine for the first couple of months and then the squeak started. I have oiled it and tightened the screws, but still the loud squeaking. I called Sunny Health Fitness many times and continuously got a message stating the voice mail was full. I emailed and over a month later I received a response asking for proof of purchase and details of problem. I provided this information along with video and it's been another month and still no reply. After many calls to Sunny Health Fitness, I continue to get the same voice message saying their mail box is full. The video attached is of me walking at a slow pace. The faster I walk or run the louder the annoying squeak! I must now pay someone to come out and repair the treadmill, since it would be too much of a hassle to try and return it. I would not recommend this treadmill to anyone. Spend more money and get a product from a company with better customer service."

Itâs ok, you just have to be aware of your feet placement as you walk/run. Iâm 5â8â so it was ok for me but I could imagine taller people not having a great time on the machine.\nWe ended up returning it because Amazon did not have the parts for it in stock and we didnât want to swap out for the same one.\nWe would have just kept this one if it worked the first time around.\nRecommendation\nIf buying on amazon, buy one that is sold by and shipped by amazon.

     "name": "My last treadmill died after 7 years of daily use, but I didn't want to spend that much right now so I went with this model and brand I wasn't aware of based on the reviews. It works really well overall. I love that I have the 12 options for incline, the buttons on the side rail to increase the speed and incline is also handy. The deck is more narrow than the ProForm I had, but seems to work out just fine for me. The front cover of the walking deck is actually better positioned as I don't find my feet hitting it like I did with my ProForm. As others stated but I didn't understand, the arm rails are short in length. They are at a decent height for me at 5'5\" but they do not extend as far towards me as I prefer so I look slightly hunched when I use them. Not enough of an issue to return but something to be aware of. The shape of the arm rails is also awkward and took getting used to as it's a skinny rectangle which is not comfortable for my hands like my previous treadmills that had round handles. Overall the price was great, delivery was easy and my husband didn't have any trouble putting it together. It is quite heavy though so carrying it down stairs just the two of us did have me tweak my back - so make sure you have more arm strength than I do and you'll be fine."

Helps pass the time while exercising.\nThis thing is heavy so you may need someone to help get it in the house and to where you are going to use it. The assembly was very easy and only a couple of pieces to put together. Take your time and enjoy. make sure to lubricate the belt.

The directions could use a bit better details and plug would be safer from getting injured in shipping if it detached from machine. Packing was not great as not enough padding. one bar was bent during shipping so cosmetically it isnât perfect. It works okay though and fir the money I am grateful. One other thing to note, the wheels are more decorative than useful for moving. A shame as seems like an easy fix. Will check back in a year and let you know how it holds up ."

In our case, there is a large crack on the console and now a hole in the piece that runs along the belt. I would have been okay with that because I expected that it could happen in shipping. I got on it for the first time today and after 8 minutes, the display went blank. I turned it off and turned it back on, tried again. Same thing.

     "name": "I bought this treadmill because I wanted one where it would increase or decrease the incline without getting off of it to adjust it. This one accomplishes this requirement without issue. I enjoy being able to press a button and the incline increases or decreases. The unit has programmed workouts which are printed out in the manual. I would like to have seen them drawn out graphically because I donât like trying to figure them out. Yes, I know itâs human nature to know what is coming so we can prepare for it.\nThe unit is quiet and I do have on the mat for it. However, when the unit was moved it make a noise. I simply raised it and lowered it. I havenât hear the noise sense. There is no noise when the incline is being used there is also no noise. This unit holds a consistent speed regardless if the incline is used or not. Iâve had the issue with the old Reebok treadmills speeding up and slowing down which caused issues.\nAssembling the unit was easy to accomplish! I will give some advice. One, cats love boxes and to help therefore you may want to put them in another room. Second is do the assembly on a mat or cardboard. Sliding it around the floor may scratch it.\nI did have an issue where the unit where the control panel went out. I called their support number and was immediately assisted with getting this matter resolved. The issue was it took almost two weeks for the unit to arrive! Once the new control panel arrived I had to wait a day for it to warm up because it was Winter time. The console was easy to replace and the treadmill as a whole has worked without issue since the control panel has arrived.\nEven with the control panel going out and the long shipping time I have recommended this unit to other people. I use it twice a day and when Iâm not using it my cats use it as a bed! It was worth the investment."

The treadmill itself is narrow, so it is easy to get off the path, which means you really need to stay focused while running.\nSecond, the display is hard to read, as it doesn't have especially high resolution. In addition, there's no flexibility in which information is displayed. I have a Sunny Fitness rower, and that seems to be a regular problem with them.\nFinally, don't get too excited by the idea of Bluetooth speakers. They are tiny and tinny-sounding, and it's pretty obvious they'll blow out sooner rather than later if played at full volume."

This treadmill had overall good reviews & negative seemed to be more due to shipping issues (damaged or something not working properly out of the box). Delivery guys brought the box just inside my door & box was in great condition (unlike some reviews).\nTaking it out of the box is a project, but install was simple. Only issue few of the screws were tough trying to screw in the pre-drilled holes.\nDefinitely following the instructions which call for oiling before use which was also easy to do.\nOnly tried it once after setting up for about 15 minutes, but everything works & seems relatively quiet IMO. The incline is definitely a nice feature especially in this price range. The display is ok, speakers arenât anything special but there if you want to use them.\nThe motor seems ok for 2.2HP\nDisplay belt dimensions 49.5L * 16.5â (would of liked belt tad wider but doable especially for walking)\nWeight of treadmill 121 lbs (yes it has wheels but not the easiest to move around).\nMax weight supports up to 240lb.\nWarranty - Think they could of done little better here. âBelieveâ itâs only 180 days on parts, labor is up to you doing it yourself or hiring someone when outside of California or something along those lines.

It would be right down the middle with no incline, then would slide to one side when I inclined it. The fix was simple - I moved it a few inches, lifted it all the way up and let it settle, then realigned, and it's been perfect since.\nGo ahead and order another bottle of good quality oil - you'll use the included bottle very quickly.

The treadmill is quite heavy out of the box (take note), but took only 30 minutes to set up once we got it upstairs. It folds up easily for storage against a wall and is easier to move in the upright position. The auto-incline option is my favorite as I can change my exercise routine on the fly and don't have to stop to adjust or worry about pinched fingers! There are \"quick buttons\" on the display for changing incline and speed, or you can do it manually in small increments using the buttons on the handles. I don't feel that the heart rate monitor is accurate, but that's of little concern to me. I did purchase a mat to put underneath the treadmill to help protect the floor. I've used this treadmill almost daily for the last 2.5 months and highly recommend it!"

     "name": "I've had this treadmill for 5 weeks and have put 35-40 miles on it. So far it is great! If you're looking for a functional treadmill to hop onto for a run or walk and don't need all of the bells and whistles, this is it. Easy to put together by yourself, took me about 40 minutes unpacking, fiddling, and checking the track for adjusting. It would be much easier to move the package with two people. What's great: It's solid, with it's weight it does not move around when you're running (i have it on a berber carpeted floor). The power incline is great. The running track is not flimsy, feels good to run on - be sure to apply the lubricant! The pulse monitors are good, kind of have to move my hands around a bit to get an accurate reading, but it's accurate. It's small dimensions are great if space is a concern -- I don't even fold it up. I have folded it up a couple times just to test it out, and the track lifts easily. It took a bit of poking to get the lock to disengage to lower the track, but I was being cautious. The track lowers slowly by itself. The display is lit and easy to see. Things to consider about this treadmill: It is small. I'm 5'7\" and the running track is just long and wide enough. I think if I were any bigger or had a longer stride this treadmill would not be comfortable to run on. Depending on the incline and how fast you're going, there will be some squeaking sounds, which is to be expected. The treadmill itself is reasonably quiet, and even running on it at lower speeds isn't too noisy. Above 5 mph, the track and foot noise gets loud enough to where I have to turn up the tv volume higher than usual. Connecting a phone over blutooth was really easy, but I don't use it. The speakers do not add anything, they sound about the same as your cell phone speaker(s). Overall, it has been exactly what I hoped it would be -- a decent, reliable, low-cost treadmill!"

The actual moving surface is narrow so we both find ourselves very attentive to keeping our strides on the straight and narrow. Using the built in programs is easy.

The volume doesnât get loud enough, and it is tinny, with zero bass to back it up. When youâre running at speed you might as well get a higher power Bluetooth boombox or use earbuds because I gave up trying to listen to music over the sound of the motor/belt/my feet, after about one song.\nThe incline function is nice, however a little slow to change.\nOverall not bad. Maybe a little overpriced, Iâd like to see this model at the $600-even range.\nRunning and walking on it is nice however, and thatâs of course the main reason I bought it so Iâll give it four stars."

The belt is decently long/wide for me. My husband is 6'1\" and he also has no problem using it. I have done intervals of running on it as well and that was comfortable too.\nThe only thing I would say to consider ahead of time is that this is pretty heavy. When the box came to our house it was difficult for my husband and I to carry inside. We were putting it in our basement and had to take all the pieces out of the box to fit them down the stairs. The main large piece is super heavy and we struggled a bit to get it down the stairs. But once we had everything where it needed to be, the set-up was very easy.\nWe did receive a small bottle of belt lubricant but I just ordered more online because I noticed the belt not running as smoothly (which is expected with how frequently we use it).\nOverall I am super happy with this purchase.

I bought the service plan when I bought the treadmill, but when I called them to come out, they said they couldn't come out until my seller's warranty was up. So I called the seller, and a very nice lady tried to give me instructions on how to take the console apart to make sure the wires were connected (and since everything else works I doubted this was the problem), but I told her that I am a senior and can't do jobs like that. Believe it or not, she actually told me to bring the treadmill in to be checked out. So if I can't take apart the console how can I left the treadmill and hike it down a flight of stairs, not to mention fitting it in a car.

     "name": "I was very excited to finally receive my machine, days after the delivery date. The instructions were fairly straightforward and there were not too many steps to assemble. The problem was that the motor cover pre-assembled came broken in many spots. The manual said to contact the company before returning the machine. My husband placed this call only to be told to send an email. I have sent NUMEROUS emails as well as pictures of the damage and have never heard anything back from them. If you are paying full price for an undamaged treadmill, do not purchase from this company. They obviously do not stand behind their products. The one star is the result of their professionalism."

     "name": "After 11 months of moderate use, the buttons on the console refused to start the belt or raise/lower the running surface. So I called the support number listed, and much to my surprised, was connected directly to a support person without going thru the typical voice mail tree.\nSteven was knowledgable and walked me through a couple simple diagnostics. (Hope you have a philips screwdriver ;-) ). He was patient and easy to talk to. Sent me a followup email of things I could try and asked me to call back after I did. After stepping thru, I found the problem and everything is working again.\nLets be clear, if you buy a treadmill for less than $1k, don't expect the same durability that you see at your local gym. But to get support at this price point is amazing. Bet you don't even get this level of support if you buy the $5k treadmills."

Best treadmill for under 700 in my opinion.\nPros\nDecent track size\nAuto incline\nSimple\nHand rail incline and speed adjustments\nFeels pretty sturdy for price\nThe lip to hold a rack to hold my laptop\nEasy adjustment to track\nEasy to assemble. 10min\nIt is quite compared to others in this price range\nBluetooth in the case of a mid work out call\nCons\nThe speakers are really bad, not that I would ever use them. Maybe for calls only.\nIt does take some time out of box to adjust track to say centered. Minor set back."

     "name": "I read quite a few reviews on many different treadmills including this one and was sold on the speed of delivery, the ease of construction and the soft drop feature. Let me not forget the Bluetooth and aux cord capabilities as well! I read that this one doesn't compare to gym models, but the compact and slim design are perfect for the home environment! I actually love the slender look of the belt. When you're running and/or walking, you don't want to be all over the place, and this slender design keeps you in place easily.\nMy only drawback, when you are in a good running stride, you have to make sure you're not too close to the front of the treadmill, otherwise, your balled swinging fists, will hit the arm grips, and OUCH! Lol. Also, the display flickers when you jog/run. Other than these few things, I'm quite satisfied with my purchase."

Since day one, whenever you touch any metal part of it, it shocks you back, when you place your phone in order to listen to music there is static noise. The return window through Amazon closed on 3/16/2021. This treadmill has been barely used and it has been used with extreme care; therefore I am afraid this is only the beginning of many other issues. I have contacted Sunny Health & Fitness directly with the hope that they will allow me to return it and be issued a refund. I will be contacting Amazon as well to see if they can make an exception and extend the return window. Wish me luck!"

     "name": "Fitbit gifts has gotten everyone motivated to \"get their steps in\" this year. Living in Florida and being in our 60's, walking around in the summer, or rain, or when mosquitos are dive bombing you can be an uncomfortable experience that can quickly drain your motivation.\nI did not want to spend an arm and a leg, but I did want a treadmill that had a good amount of incline, but I wanted incline that I could change on the fly without getting off and having to make adjustments manually like a lot of decent treadmills have. After days of research and reading reviews, I decided on the Sunny Health & Fitness 7515.\nIt has a ton of great features. Heck, I don't even care I can sync my phone to it through Bluetooth, answer it and talk through the built in microphone, or play music through the built in speakers. Two large cup/bottle holders is a great plus! Easy to read display, and the ability to control incline and speed from either the keypad itself or buttons on the hand rails. It's pretty darn quiet for a treadmill that is under $500. Mine is in a carpeted bedroom, and also sits on a basic treadmill pad, and when it is running you can barely hear it in other rooms when the door is closed. I like to watch TV when I'm walking, and even with my old ears, I don't have to turn the TV up load to hear it over the treadmill. It has 12 built in programs that will change the speed and incline of your workout, and 3 blank programs you can set up yourself. The level 3 program kicked my butt.\nAssembly was really easy. The toughest part is getting it out of the box. It folds very easily as well, and when you \"kick\" the leg to drop it, it drops VERY slowly which is nice and \"safe\". The \"rollers\" seem more designed for a hard floor or a very low pile carpet. It didn't want to roll on the mat sitting on a carpet. One thing I will state is go to the manufacturer's web site. They have some videos that you may find helpful. Specifically on how to lubricate the belt for the first time. The instruction booklet was kind of vague on it, but the video was very specific on how to do it.\nSo far, this product has lived up to the positive reviews I have read on Amazon. Based on the negative feedback I have read, I recommend you carefully read and follow the instructions carefully. There are video's on the website, and the instruction booklet has instructions for the most common issues, such as the belt sliding to one side. Mine has not done that yet, but if it does, I know what to do to fix it! :) Seriously, this is a great product for the price."

     "name": "Perfect addition to our garage gym. If there is one positive thing to come out of the year 2020 for me-it is that I have a fully functional garage gym now. The treadmill completed the gym. Now I can easily do my street parking workouts-no need to sub running when itâs raining or smoky (from wildfires) outside.\nTreadmill looked intimidating to set up. However once I removed all the items from the box, it took only about 30 minutes to put together.\nI have used for a week thus far-with a mixture of walking/jogging/sprinting. Works great.\nWater bottle fits perfectly-does move slightly when running, but not a distraction. Phone sits on tray near screen. Phone does slightly cover screen, not bothersome to me though.\nThe incline isnât as high as I would have liked, but for the price it is perfect. The incline still creates a great burn.\nThe OCD in me would prefer when you hit âstopâ that the timer stop counting. Instead you hit stop and the time/distance continues until the belt has stopped moving.\nPros: affordable, can now walk/run indoors, easy to set up, footprint doesnât take up much space, can pause and restart where you left off, auto-incline (much preferred over manual incline), spot to put phone/iPad if watching program.\nCons: shipping was a disaster (no fault of amazon or Sunny), would prefer to not have incline/speed on the handles (if Iâm sprinting I prefer to grab the handles when stopping)."

     "name": "First I appreciate the supplier for getting it to me faster than expected. Extra cudos for that. It is good to work out on. It has time working out, distance, calories used, pulse (pulse reading might be off sometimes). I would hope like to pass on and stress to be sure NOT to release the belt strap before assembly. It snapped open and added 30 minutes to set up. Otherwise I would guess about 15-20 minutes to set up. It is a little narrow and less supportive than gym machines but they probably cost about $2000 + more. You can hear your footsteps while listening to music and being a little narrow, a grade of A. If compared to a gym machine costing $2500 or more A-."

     "name": "This treadmill arrived the other week very quickly (a day earlier than expected) and the poor delivery man helped bring it in for me because of how heavy it was. After that I was very nervous to assemble since it's only me, but the hardest part was getting it in and opening it all up and getting the parts out of the box. It's doable to put together alone but definitely easier with another person. I was impressed with how little I had to do to screw in everything - it's basically 75% already put together for you. I really like the incline and speed options - it is very straightforward and for the price you pay worth it, and I like how narrow it is so it can fit nicely along a wall even in the smallest of spaces. Only complaints so far are is it is pretty loud as I walk and it gets louder the more I incline but nothing some headphones can't fix to try to tune it out. Also it is extremely heavy, again to move alone, and the wheels are kind of useless, but it is easy to fold up and fold down. And to note, I bought this the week of 1/4, and the following week after it arrived I saw it was marked down substantially. Now checking today it is even more so. Perhaps if you are ready to pull the trigger here, just give it another week or so because of the price fluctuations. Amazon couldn't credit me back for about 80 bucks difference which was upsetting, however all in all this is a great purchase that I enjoy using, especially working from home!"

It's not cool to be able to ship this assembly but it was almost on my porch and it's no worse for wear because it's actually a good product. I don't ask much. I walk on it for about a mile, fold it back up. The hydraulics are impressively smooth when pulling the deck down or lifting it up. I put moving pads under it to be able to push it around the hardwood floor. Haven't used incline or Bluetooth yet but I haven't needed to. I'm glad I got it. It's adequately powered, comfortable for my size and weight and I feel safe on it. I surf the web on my phone and walk and I have not been dissapointed."

It is relatively easy to assemble (some of the pieces didn't line up correctly and required some manhandling to make it work), it is easy to use, and it feels solid. The thing I truly love is the auto incline adjustment. I can't imagine having to do that manually.\nMain issue is the sound system. Terrible to say the least. Speakers buzz unless you adjust cord just right (and then the vibration from running will get it out of whack again). The sound controls on the treadmill do not work, and the sound is generally bad. For me, not a deal-breaker. Just disappointing. Also, there is an occasional squeaking in the treadmill that is irritating but, again, not a problem so far. One thing to be aware of, though. The track is narrow. It is fine for me and my daughter, but my husband hits the sides pretty regularly.\nLike I said, fine for the price. But all three of agree that next purchase will be a big upgrade. We wanted to test the treadmill-use waters, and this was a great first purchase."

Itâs smooth, easy to use, great features with auto incline. My only complaint is that it only goes up to 8mph. Most other treadmills in its class go up to 10 mph. At a top speed of 8 mph it just doesnât quite give me what I need when interval training. Feels like a fast jog. The only saving grace is that it goes up to 12% incline so that helps make the 8mph feel faster. If I had to redo it I would have purchased one that went at least 10mph. I believe this is a huge deciding factor. Now if your a person who walks or jogs only then this is a great treadmill and you wonât be disappointed."

I could still read it but something was off. I tried to run again and it jammed again after about a quarter mile or so. I reset it and this was the screen. No physical damage and it was completely fried. I tried everything and then had to send back and fight for my refund.

The treadmill isn't loud when it's running but when I walk it tends to be slightly loud and that could be because of my weight. . . IDK. The pulse rate monitor so far is okay but you have to have the palms of your hands flat and gripping the handles for an accurate reading. I wear my Fitbit so that's not a biggie for me. The display screen is bright and visiable no complaints there. I added a picture to show you where I place my tablet in front of the display screen. I love all the extra amenities such as the bluetooth, the volume is loud and the sound is clear. The bottle holders are wide enough for my phone, keys, and bottle of water.

When I use my bike I read a book and when I treadmill I watch GMA, don't need to pay every month for some membership. I passed on the ProForm treadmills because of this. I purchased a ProForm recumbent bike for our Florida Place thinking it was going to be like the one I purchased several years ago. The thing came with some useless built in programs that had absolutely no information. Had to find out by trial and error that there were no programs suitable for rehabbing my knee. The Sunny Health & Fitness SF-T7515 by contrast came with 12 programs that are well documented and cover a wide range of difficulty. The SF-T7515 was super easy to assemble (like 6 bolts and 4 screws) and seems super rugged. I've only done one workout out so far but it was smooth and quiet. I love the automated incline and how its implemented in the programs. If I have had to change one thing it would be to make the grip bars round or more rounded than they are. Other than that for the money I think this is a great treadmill for the average person. Definitely thinking about checking out their recumbent exercise bikes as I can still return the ProForm!"

     "name": "I am enjoying this treadmill. It was easy to assemble, doesn't take up a lot of room and seems pretty sturdy. I like having the speaker built in, one less item I need to remember to grab. It's easy to get started, while it is programmable, I prefer to adjust speed and incline on my own. I also like the pause button, it picks right back up after hitting start so you don't lose your place. I read a Kindle while walking and wish the tray area was up a tad bit higher ( I am 5'5). I also wish the incline and speed buttons on the bars weren't there, I hit them on accident frequently. All in all, good product for the price."

It is heavy as expected but very easy to assemble with only four bolts to insert and very stable when in use. I use it daily to walk 3 miles. It operates really well with no glitches. I really like the time, distance and calorie counter modes where it shuts down when you reach your alotted goals. In addition the user designed programs are handy and easy to set. It does MPH in the US and not KPH as some units do. I would highly recommend this product."

I really like the looks of this treadmill, I did a lot of research before choosing this one, but Iâm glad I did it has so many features that I wanted in a treadmill like speakers, auto incline, big cup holders, a place to put, your keys, phone, also a place for your tablet. I like the big display, all the features, the pause on it, heart rate. Itâs very heavy duty, sturdy, and quite. I also like the safety feature on it.

They responded after 3 weeks only saying \"give us the part number\". What is that supposed to mean? I sent them the part number for the power switch from their diagram. They have not responded again. But how is that going to help me? I don't know how to replace the power switch. I wish I could return it. But how am I supposed to pack and return its when I can hardly move it? And am I supposed to unpack and reassemble?

The Bluetooth has no password (that I can find), do anyone can connect to it. I discovered this when I heard random music blasting through the speakers, not my music. With the treadmill having a microphone, thereâs a risk of someone being able to tap in and listen to your conversations without you knowing. And there was no way for me to disconnect the strangerâs speaker, so I had to unplug the entire thing. Leave it unplugged when. It in use to help mitigate this issue.

Sure this treadmill doesnt have a fancy colored screen that shows images of you running through downtown San Francisco, but who really needs that to get their cardio in? I've only had the unit for 1 month so I cannot speak to the durability, but based on other reviews I expect support on this to be pretty sufficient.

I contacted Sunny Health, and their customer service is horrible, and did nothing to help me out (the reviews are right). Amazon send me a replacement, and the replacement arrived damaged with broken parts. I contact them again, they weren't much help, so I called Amazon, and ask for my refund. The replacement was scheduled to be picked up on a scheduled date, and they didn't show up, so I had to reschedule for another pickup date. Sometimes we give the benefit of doubt to companies like Sunny Health, hoping our situation won't be like the bad reviews we read about, but they were right, I should of not bought it.

I would strongly advise purchasing a bottle of lubricant as the lubricant that comes with it does not go very far. Had to re-center it but I am sure after shipping, things can get a little out of whack. Re-centering was easy and covered in the instructions. All in all, a sturdy piece of equipment for my needs to get some extra steps in every day. Worth spending a little extra money for a reliable product/vendor as the first one I ordered never arrived."

The motor itself is relatively silent whenever it is operating. The pulse sensor feature is cool but the monitor only shows the speed. Bluetooth speakers are working well though sometimes the machine needs to be turned on/off to estblish a connection. Overall, the device is easy to assemble but you may need help moving it as it is quite heavy. The major issue I had was that the end caps of the running pad as well as the motor cover was broken due to shipping (my apartment being on the second may have aggravated this). Customer service has to be improved as the contact number rarely have someone to speak with. Also, when I was able to finally talk to the customer service through phone, the first person did not follow through. To summarize I beleive the machine is a good buy but company needs to improve both their system of packaging to avoid shipping damage and their customer service needs more people so they can help more customers with their machine issues."

It's easy to adjust speed and inclination on the fly.

The machine was easy to assemble unassisted and has performed smoothly and flawlessly. My only user criticism is due to my 6'3\" height.

It would be nice to get a response from support, they had no problem\nProcessing my payment quickly, but then I have to wait 2 weeks for a support response because of their lack of clarity? Unacceptable!!!"

Just to bad it canât at least be adjusted."

The auto incline feature, speed and incline controls on the handle bars. Beverage holders, blue tooth, and MP3 jack. Folds up nice and moves fairly easy. Heart rate monitors, every thing you expect in a higher end treadmill for a really reasonable price. The only thing that is negative is it is lightweight, its rated for 220lb or lower in the ad. Although my paperwork says 250lb. That said, I wouldn't do high impact running on it if you are close to that weight. I'm 200lb and plan to use it for mostly walking.

Then we received the treadmill and my husband and I were immediately disappointed. When we opened the box there were several pieces of the plastic that were already broken off. We decided to continue to assemble the treadmill hoping that it would still be a good purchase. We started the treadmill and my husband was unable to walk or run on it as it would not hold his weight. We tried tightening and loosing the belt but it was still not strong enough for him. He weighs 200 lbs. and it claims to be able to support up to 250 lbs. I even noticed that when I use the treadmill it is a bit jerky which feels dangerous like I might fall off. I weigh 140 lbs so I am not light but I should not be too heavy for this treadmill. Not sure if the machine we got is just finicky and the other treadmills are better quality but so far I am not super pleased with this purchase."

The seller really should have explained that more clearly in the product description, because Iâm reading a lot of comments where people bought it thinking Bluetooth meant compatibility with more apps than just music.\nI was disappointed to not be able to buy this Sunny Health treadmill because it has everything I was looking for... (auto incline, 2hp, good running surface size, good reviews, folding, decent price, etc).\nI finally found those same things in a treadmill by SereneLife and it does sync via Bluetooth to a treadmill running app (and music app). Iâm very happy with my purchase of the âSereneLife Foldable Digital Home Gym Treadmill | Smart Auto Inclineâ for $499"

I expected them to be weak or sound weird, but they actually sound really great! I had to use my adapter for my phone to be able to plug it in, but I was able to watch Netflix-and hear-while walking and running. The controls on the handles are great too! Itâs so convenient.

     "name": "UPDATED REVIEW 6/14/21 ZERO STARS\nWithout explanation, the treadmill will periodically refuse to turn on or will shut down while in use. During these times, some or all of the buttons will not respond. One time, the belt continued to run, yet the stop button did not work. Thankfully, the emergency stop did work. Another time, the belt suddenly increased from 4mph to 8mph. Currently, for the last two days, the treadmill refuses to start, even though the display and most of the buttons work.\nThe, there is the issue with its inability to maintain the incline. The ramp will increase to the height I want, but over the next 30 to 60 seconds, it will always drop down to 3%.\nCustomer service is non-existent. I have tried contacting the seller by email, phone, through Amazon, without any response. The user manual does not have any useful information. There is no reset button on this. This unit has become a $500 clothes hanger. A complete waste of money. I will never buy from this company again.\nUpdated review 1/30/21 TWO STARS:\nWe have used this treadmill for more than three months. We average 15 hours a week on it. It has done an adequate job. It is beginning to squeak or whine, intermittently.\nI downgraded this from 4 stars to 2 because of customer service. A few weeks ago the treadmill suddenly died. It had been used for an hour, there was an hour break, and then I went to use it again. It started to run, but died when I tried to raise the incline. No warning, no reason. The bluetooth connection and speakers still worked, the screen worked, but the motor would not run.\nI made innumerable calls to the customer service line without any ever picking up the phone. It just rang endlessly each time. Neither the website nor the manual had any answer for this problem. I used Sunny's online inquiry since there was no other way to reach the company. They sent an automated messaging advising it would be 6-10 business days before we would get a response. Nope, it was 21 business days before we got a response and it was less than helpful. All they did was ask for the model number, sales receipt, etc - this was all information that was required on the initial submission and which we had provided already. The response gave us no clue at all about what to do.\nFortunately, after the machine sat unused for a day, it suddenly came back to life. All I could figure is that sweat seeped into the controllers on the arms, and shorted out the circuitry, and that a day of rest allowed it to dry out.\nNow, I have little faith that this unit will last long term, and I am absatively confident that when it does conk out. Sunny will give zero support, leaving us with an large, expensive piece of trash that we must dispose of.\nORIGINAL REVIEW from October 2020 - FOUR STARS\nThis treadmill has exceeded expectations. It is sturdy and works well. In brief, this makes a good home walking/light jogging treadmill with nice features and at a reasonable price. If you want gym quality, you will need to spend at least 2x as much. For a home gym, it is solid and a good value.\nAssembly was simple. It took longer for me to move it into my house or to unpack, then it did to assemble. I have no handyman skills, so this was a pleasant surprise that I assembled it in minutes and without any difficulty. They provide all of the tools needed, and the directions were clear. The unit was very-well packed; perhaps too-well. Between the Styrofoam, reinforced cardboard, and wooden bracers, it should not get damaged during delivery or bringing into the home.\nI am 204lbs and had concerns whether this would handle my weight. That was not a problem. The frame is made of steel and there are stabilizers to keep it grounded. There is no movement in the unit when walking and no creaking when I lean on the handles. There is sufficient room between the handles for me to fit, which was another concern. My hips do not come any where close to the machine's arms. The walking tread is long enough for a fast walking or slow jogging stride. This is not designed for runners with long strides.\nThe amenities are good. My only gripe is that I cannot input my BMI or weight, unless I am using a program (though there might be a way, but I am not aware of it). The display is easy to read, showing time lapsed, distance in miles, calories burned, speed, and inclination. The auto-incline was flawless, raising/lowering quickly and without difficulty. Changing speeds was simple. It is nice having speed and incline controls on the arms, but too often I accidentally changed speed or incline. The heart rate monitor is convenient and accurate. Connecting a blue tooth device is simple. The speakers are mediocre, at best, for listening to music, but adequate if you are streaming a movie on your tablet. The control deck fits my 10\" tablet nicely. The cups are large enough to hold 24 ounce bottles and larger.\nSimple raising the walking deck is easywith the hydraulic assist. Lower the deck is easy, but it is very slow dropping due to the hydraulic release. It is not advised to force the walking tread to lower faster.\nA big gripe about the arm controls. I am frequently, accidentally hitting the speed increase or ramp up. More than once I accidentally sent this from a comfortable 3.5mph to well over 4mph, risking injury to myself."

     "name": "After about 3 months of use, this treadmill started making a knocking noise that is quite loud. I reached out via email to Sunny Health, who, although responsive and suggested things to try, nothing worked. I asked if they had any local service staff that could come and look at it and the answer was no. I guess I should have read more of the reviews before purchasing. Although it was the size treadmill that I was looking for...it was a waste of money."

     "name": "I bought this treadmill back in October of 2020, despite waiting 2 MONTHS!! to receive it, it finally came. Assembly wasn't an issue and everything was working perfectly until 3 weeks in. After 3 weeks, I started noticing some screeching sounds coming from the treadmill. Not thinking much of it, I just added some lubricant thinking I hadn't put enough the first time. However, after a week later, the treadmill started to vibrate and shake violently.\nI tried contacting Sunny but with no luck, so I contacted a treadmill repair company in my area, in which they told me that the back roller needed to be replaced and that they only way to get one is through Sunny. Now here's the best part, being that Sunny is a US company, their guarantee only applies to those who reside in the US, not in Canada. After multiple failed attempts to get a hold of them through the phone, I sent an email. I HAVE NEVER SEEN WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN MY LIFE!! It takes them at least 2 weeks to answer my emails and disregard any updates I ask for. I've been trying to get a part shipped for the past 2 months yet their lack of communication makes it impossible!! I haven't been able to use my treadmill and with every day that passes by I get more frustrated that they don't answer. One star for horrible customer service!! Never buying anything from them ever again"
