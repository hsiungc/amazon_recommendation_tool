<h1>Amazon Recommendation Tool</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The Amazon Seller Recommendation Tool gives sellers the ability to determine whether a certain product they want to sell is competitive within the Amazon marketplace.  Using parsed product data (input), the tool will provide the seller with a variety of metrics in the product category ranging from general statistics to an overall score recommending whether the product is a good sell to make.</p>

<h3>Metrics & Process</h3>

<p>The analyzed data are classified under three key classes:</p>
<p>•	<b>Product Characteristics</b> – Name, price, material, size and weight, seller, seller history, and seller ratings.<br>
•	<b>Engagement</b> – Average rating, number of reviews, review keywords (both positive and negative), attributes to improve.<br>
•	<b>Amazon Features</b> – Amazon's Choice, Amazon Brand, Prime, Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA), Best Sellers Ranking (BSR).</p>
<p>Metrics are created based on these classes.  The tool takes the product metrics and calculates the score based on an arbitrary weighting system, which are captured in a section at the top of the report output along with a summary of other performance indicators.  Metrics may be reassigned based on relevance and strength, and are categorized into the following classes:</p>

<p>•	<b>Overall Category Score</b> – The category price, size, BSR, seller history, reviews, and other product attributes are weighted and then scored.<br>
•	<b>Summary Statistics</b> – The product category performance will expand based on price range/median, total reviews, negative and positive keywords, types of sellers, overall rating, and other statistics.</p>

<p>Both the product score and statistics will display on a final report, providing recommendations and insights to the seller on whether a certain product should be sold on Amazon.</p>
